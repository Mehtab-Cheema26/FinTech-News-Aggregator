The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the third consecutive reduction and one that came with a cautionary tone about additional reductions in coming years. 

In a move widely anticipated by markets, the Federal Open Market Committee cut its overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, back to the level where it was in December 2022 when rates were on the move higher. 

Though there was little intrigue over the decision itself, the main question had been over what the Fed would signal about its future intentions as inflation holds steadily above target and economic growth is fairly solid, conditions that don’t normally coincide with policy easing. 

In delivering the 25 basis point cut, the Fed indicated that it probably would only lower twice more in 2025, according to the closely watched “dot plot” matrix of individual members’ future rate expectations. The two cuts indicated slice in half the committee’s intentions when the plot was last updated in September. 

Assuming quarter-point increments, officials indicated two more cuts in 2026 and another in 2027. Over the longer term, the committee sees the “neutral” funds rate at 3%, 0.1 percentage point higher than the September update as the level has drifted gradually higher this year. 

For the second consecutive meeting, one FOMC member dissented: Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wanted the Fed to maintain the previous rate. Governor Michelle Bowman voted no in November, the first time a governor voted against a rate decision since 2005. 

The fed funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but also influences a variety of consumer debt such as auto loans, credit cards and mortgages. 

The post-meeting statement changed little except for a tweak regarding the “extent and timing” of further rate changes, a slight language change from the November meeting. 

The cut came even through the committee jacked up its projection for full-year gross domestic product growth to 2.5%, half a percentage point higher than September. However, in the ensuing years the officials expect GDP to slow down to its long-term projection of 1.8%. 

Other changes to the Summary of Economic Projections saw the committee lower its expected unemployment rate this year to 4.2% while headline and core inflation according to the Fed’s preferred gauge also were pushed higher to respective estimates of 2.4% and 2.8%, slightly higher than the September estimate and above the Fed’s 2% goal. 

The committee’s decision comes with inflation not only holding above the central bank’s target but also while the economy is projected by the Atlanta Fed to grow at a 3.2% rate in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate has hovered around 4%. 

Though those conditions would be most consistent with the Fed hiking or holding rates in place, officials are wary of keeping rates too high and risking an unnecessary slowdown in the economy. Despite macro data to the contrary, a Fed report earlier this month noted that economic growth had only risen “slightly” in recent weeks, with signs of inflation waning and hiring slowing. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the rate cuts are an effort to recalibrate policy as it does not need to be as restrictive under the current conditions. 

With Wednesday’s move, the Fed will have cut benchmark rates by a full percentage point since September, a month during which it took the unusual step of lowering by a half point. The Fed generally likes to move up or down in smaller quarter-point increments as its weighs the impact of its actions. 

Despite the aggressive moves lower, markets have taken the opposite tack. 

Mortgage rates and Treasury yields both have risen sharply during the period, possibly indicating that markets do not believe the Fed will be able to cut much more. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury most recently yielded 4.215%, putting it in the upper range of the Fed’s rate move Wednesday.",t2_4daatxkf,False,,0,False,"Fed cuts by a quarter point, indicates fewer reductions ahead",[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1hh8x49,False,dark,0.98,,public,715,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,715,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1734548562.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong).

1. Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19.

2. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price.

3. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.

4. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD.

5. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died.

6. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here.

7. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over.

8. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

The semiconductor company reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.79, compared to Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $1.76, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $8.7 billion, which was in line with analysts’ expectations.

Micron’s outlook was weak, though. It guided the current quarter to $7.9 billion in sales, at the midpoint of its range, versus an $8.9 billion estimate from analysts.

“While consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a press release. “We continue to gain share in the highest margin and strategically important parts of the market and are exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.”

Micron shares were down as much as 17% in late trading following the report.

In management’s prepared remarks for the earnings call, the company blamed the outlook on a weaker-than-expected PC upgrade cycle. Management also saw softness in the auto and industrial markets.

Micron is a leader in the markets for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which is used in desktop computers and servers, and for flash memory, which is found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. It has also become a key supplier of HBM (high-bandwidth memory) for artificial intelligence servers.

I think AMD shares fell 5% last week despite being the leader in CPU (now that Intel is in trouble) and to a lesser extent GPU makers

I'm bullish on AMD for the following reasons

\-Replacement GPU are available on a budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand in the next few years

\-It's the best CPU for consumers and data centers, no doubt about it. and you need CPU to reason about AI models trained on GPU

\-The PC market will enter a 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with the end of Windows 10 support

\-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors

Before anyone says NVDA is 1000x better than AMD ......

I agree that AMD is not dominant in CUDA and that they are years behind NVDA in this area and may not even be close to catching up

I don't think AMD is “dead” in the consumer GPU space

I agree that most developers consider NVDA when developing games, but it's definitely a cheaper alternative to NVDA, especially in less affluent countries

I have reservations about what I'm going to say next - I think AMD is going to overshadow what's left of NVDA

Given AMD recent acquisitions, I also expect AMD to launch its own parallel computing platform.

I realize this is also an unlikely goal, but if demand surges, AMD may be considered for CUDA

I am fully invested in AMD because I think AMD is trading below its fair price

That said, I think AMD is currently worth about 150-160 fair value

&lt;p&gt;-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anyone says NVDA is 1000x better than AMD ......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that AMD is not dominant in CUDA and that they are years behind NVDA in this area and may not even be close to catching up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think AMD is “dead” in the consumer GPU space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that most developers consider NVDA when developing games, but it&amp;#39;s definitely a cheaper alternative to NVDA, especially in less affluent countries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have reservations about what I&amp;#39;m going to say next - I think AMD is going to overshadow what&amp;#39;s left of NVDA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given AMD recent acquisitions, I also expect AMD to launch its own parallel computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize this is also an unlikely goal, but if demand surges, AMD may be considered for CUDA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fully invested in AMD because I think AMD is trading below its fair price&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I think AMD is currently worth about 150-160 fair value&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The above is OP&amp;#39;s personal opinion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"JNJ is currently trading at $146.4 per share, with a market capitalization of $352.49 billion. But the market may be overlooking its potential.

Several valuation models indicate JNJ is priced below its intrinsic value. Estimates range from a 31.7% to a 48.8% discount. Lemme break this down:  


* **Intrinsic Value Estimate:** $192.8 per share. This is based on a conservative growth outlook.
* **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model:** $217.9 per share. This calculation uses a 6.9% discount rate and a 3.0% long-term growth rate.
* **Relative Valuation:** $167.6 per share. Even using this method, which often shows lower values than intrinsic value models, JNJ shows upside potential. 



The consistency across these different valuation methods supports the conclusion of a price below fair value.  


Now, let's look at the financial picture. JNJ's last twelve months (LTM) free cash flow (FCF) was $19.5 billion, generated on LTM revenue of $87.7 billion. Its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin is 21.1%, slightly below its five-year average of 22.4%. However, the market appears to be pricing in a -2.8% annual decline in free cash flow over the next decade. This is in contrast to JNJ's three-year average FCF growth of 4.6% and the industry average of 8.2%. This discrepancy suggests the market's outlook may be too pessimistic.  


Projections for the next ten years (2024-2034) show:  


* Revenue growth from $88.7 billion to $130.3 billion (a 4.0% CAGR).
* Operating income (EBIT) increasing from $22.1 billion to $32.4 billion.
* Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) rising from $20.9 billion to $30.6 billion (a 2.3% CAGR). 

This projected growth is steady and reflects the stability often associated with established companies like JNJ. The market-implied value of growth (MIVoG) is 27.8% of enterprise value, suggesting the market may be underestimating its future growth potential.  


Based on my projections, expected annual returns are approximately 3.1% over three years and 6.8% over five years. These returns include projected earnings growth (3.7%), shareholder yield (4.0%), and a decrease in valuation multiples (-4.6%).

JNJ has a slightly high P/E ratio, yeah, but the price-to-value gap and strong cash flow generation make it an interesting stock to watch for. Overall score: 9 of 10, according to Value Sense.

,stocks,"I don't currently have a position, as I'm trying to figure out the best position to enter.

I'd like to share a short thesis for Carvana ($CVNA). I know there have been a few posts on Carvana outlining fraud or technical analysis on the more degenerate places on reddit but I'd like to present a more complete thesis that the Carvana implosion will happen in the next 8 to 13 months - perhaps less. It's really a question of when confidence in the company gets shot.

It may not be this upcoming earnings period but certainly could be the next. I'll be following CarMax closely as the press release announcing their earnings for this week a full 15 days early - never before has CarMax issued a press release for a standard earnings date before the quarter ended. CarMax's earnings beat/misses don't seem to correlate with Carvana's earnings beat/misses.

How do I know that Carvana is going to collapse? Because I read the bonds. Their free cash flow cannot cover the repayment scheme and their early payments are lipstick on a pig which have no meaningful effect. This was known when the deal was pushed through. I'm fairly certain that as Carvana went up and up and up people forgot some of those top line numbers and those dates.

The Bonds:

Tranche 1: 12.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2028

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K. or Cash (CVNA's discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 2: 13.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% or 11% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2030

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K. or 11% Cash (CVNA's discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 3: 14.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2031

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K.February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

A little translation: P.I.K. is Paid In Kind - basically added to the principle at that interest rate. That provides a fair amount of leeway for Carvana to kick the can down the road, however, that road ""ends"" on August 15th. In October/November's earnings they'll be forced to addressed the repayments which exceed their free cash flow. Or not. After that, on February 15th 2026 a whole lotta money is due and there's no way they can not address it in February's earnings call. Actually, there's little value in computing how much is due at those times because it simply cannot be repaid. Free cash flow for the last two quarters was around $600-$700m (total), and debt payments will be close to $220M or more in any 2 quarters - a full third of the (now) positive FCF. Carvana will not be able to buy cars to expand. And the chance of them doubling their free cash flow is slim - even as they eak out a slim profit.

I could only see Tranche 1 August payments they made last earnings as a token ""show of force"" - $100m prepayment is a drop in the bucket on $5-7B in debt and only trims the expected interest by virtually nothing. It also does explain why the executive team is bailing now - the farther out from these maturities they bail the less likely they could experience clawbacks for engaging in fraud (a'la Sears Roebuck &amp; Co - it's not fraud if it's being conducted openly and for a long time).

Since Caravana is split between Hold through Strong Buy, well, another reason not to trust analysts.

One missed earnings and this company is toast. Increased inflation and this company is toast. Tariffs may support Carvana more than I would like as used cars won't face tariffs, but inflation caused by labor deportations and increased COL from tariffs between Mexico and Canada will completely negate that - particularly if used car loan defaults go up (they are) and loan restrictions start going up (they are according to FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STDSAUTO)

The question is, is this the top? Long term LEAP puts are expensive-ish, but this company will be driven down to $3 within a few months of February - either before or after.

Update/Edit: I ran some interest only numbers which are in the discussion.  Long and the short, CVNA will have interest expenses of about $440M per-year when these convert to cash interest next year, up from interest expenses of $12.5M now.  They also have a $98M unsecured bond due in 2025, which they could possibly refinance or re-issue.  There free cash flow is increasing, from 2024Q1:$100M to 2024Q3: $400M.  However, this needs to be maintained - any economic shocks would still cripple their ability to repay their debt or buy cars.  An strict repayment only holds the debt steady at $5.2B - functionally turning Carvana into a Zombie Corp.  The can could be kicked down the road to 2028, but probably not if interest rates increase.  Interest rate increases or weakness in consumer subprime auto lending lasting longer than a quarter would cripple the company.

,stocks,"Alphabet-owned Waymo announced Monday that it will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Tokyo in early 2025, the company’s first step toward international expansion. 

Waymo hasn’t committed to start commercial service in Tokyo yet, but the robotaxi developer will partner with Japan’s largest taxi operator, Nihon Kotsu, and taxi app GO to start testing its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles in Tokyo’s streets.

To start, Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually operate the Waymo vehicles to map key areas of the Japanese capital, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa, and Kōtō. 

Data from the manned test drives will help train the company’s AI systems. Waymo will also test its robotaxis on a closed course in the U.S. built to mimic driving conditions in Japan.

This is the first phase of the partnerships, which will last several quarters, Waymo told CNBC, adding that it expects to remain in Japan for an extended period.

“Our upcoming road trip to Tokyo gives us the chance to work alongside local partners, government officials, and community groups to understand the new landscape,” Waymo said in a statement. “We’ll learn how Waymo can serve Tokyo’s residents and become a beneficial part of the city’s transportation ecosystem.”

Nihon Kotsu will oversee the management and servicing of Waymo’s vehicles in Japan, the companies said.

Waymo announced a series of expansions across the U.S. in 2024. Earlier this month, the company announced new testing in Miami in 2025, it made its driverless ride hail service available across Los Angeles in November, and in September, it announced planned expansions into Austin and Atlanta in partnership with Uber. 

The move into Japan marks the company’s first in a left-hand traffic market.

Both the Japanese national government and Tokyo Metropolitan government see driverless technology as a potential boon to the country’s aging population, according to research by the World Economic Forum.

Tokyo has designated certain areas as “test zones” for self-driving cars hoping to hasten the arrival of safe driverless transportation systems there.

Several developers are working on autonomous vehicles in Japan, including local startup Tier IV and ZMP, a robotics company that is testing delivery vehicles and buses in Tokyo. Monet Technologies, which is partly owned by Toyota, announced plans to test a self-driving taxi service in Tokyo’s Odaiba district earlier this year.

Waymo’s Japan expansion announcement comes a week after General Motors announced it was abandoning its Cruise robotaxi division. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it aimed to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026 but would re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed.

Prior to GM’s retreat from robotaxis, Cruise had been one of Waymo’s primary domestic competitors.

&lt;p&gt;Both the Japanese national government and Tokyo Metropolitan government see driverless technology as a potential boon to the country’s aging population, according to research by the World Economic Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo has designated certain areas as “test zones” for self-driving cars hoping to hasten the arrival of safe driverless transportation systems there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several developers are working on autonomous vehicles in Japan, including local startup Tier IV and ZMP, a robotics company that is testing delivery vehicles and buses in Tokyo. Monet Technologies, which is partly owned by Toyota, announced plans to test a self-driving taxi service in Tokyo’s Odaiba district earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo’s Japan expansion announcement comes a week after General Motors announced it was abandoning its Cruise robotaxi division. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it aimed to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026 but would re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to GM’s retreat from robotaxis, Cruise had been one of Waymo’s primary domestic competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"This final full trading week of the year will be far from a sleepy slide into the holiday season.

The Federal Reserve is at a pivotal juncture when it comes to the path of interest rates, while the stock market also faces a critical week amid a period of prolonged broadening weakness.

The central bank is widely expected to cut rates Wednesday—a 97% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. That’s probably a little high, particularly given last week’s sticky inflation data.

In fact, several Fed officials are considering arguing against a cut when officials meet later this week, The Wall Street Journal reported. A hold decision would certainly be a surprise.

A cut is still most likely, but the economic data do not suggest an urgent need to reduce borrowing costs at this point. Consumer prices ticked higher to 2.7% in November, well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The economy is still growing at a decent rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, according to the GDPNow estimate, and the jobs market is showing resilience.

The counterargument is that the fed-funds rate of 4.5% to 4.75% has room to come down a bit further to align with economic conditions.

Even if a quarter-point cut does come gift-wrapped as expected for the market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could still be the Grinch who stole Christmas when he speaks after the decision.

A December cut would be the third in succession. That pace cannot continue, so Powell will need to communicate a coming shift in 2025. It could be the last cut for a while, especially given the inflationary impact of Trump’s potential tariffs.

How Powell conveys the message may be critical for the stock market’s reaction.

The S&amp;P 500 is on an unusual run—more stocks have fallen than risen for 10 consecutive days, the longest such streak since Oct. 2000. The index still hit a record high last week but the majority of stocks are struggling.

,stocks,"**Summary:**

Xinyi Solar Holdings (OTCMKTS: XNYIF), one of the world’s largest solar glass manufacturers, is showing solid growth and profitability, yet trades at a **P/E ratio of 6.5** with a **7.2% dividend yield**. Given its fundamentals, the stock seems undervalued relative to peers, potentially due to macro risks (China FUD, OTC listing). Here’s a balanced breakdown.

**The Business**

Xinyi Solar is a **global leader in solar glass production** – a critical component for all photovoltaic (PV) solar panels.

* **Core Segment**: Solar glass manufacturing, serving panel producers worldwide.
* **Revenue Streams**: Primarily regional (China and Asia), with limited exposure to U.S. tariffs.
* **Scale**: Industry-leading capacity and strong cost controls give them an edge in a competitive market.

  
**Key Financials 📊**

1. **Profit Growth**:
   * H1 2024 profits grew **+41% YoY**, showing resilience despite overcapacity fears.
2. **Dividend Yield**:
   * 7.2% yield, well-covered by cash flow, offering income stability.
3. **Valuation**:
   * P/E Ratio: **6.5**, significantly below global solar peers trading at 15–20x earnings.
4. **Margins**:
   * Operating margins are stable, showing efficient production even with pricing pressure.

**Source**: Xinyi Interim Report → [https://www.xinyisolar.com/en/NewsCenter/info.aspx?itemid=828](https://www.xinyisolar.com/en/NewsCenter/info.aspx?itemid=828)

  
**Why It’s Mispriced 🧐**

1. **OTC Stigma**: XNYIF trades OTC in the U.S., limiting visibility and volume.
2. **China Sentiment**: Concerns about Chinese stocks and trade tensions may have spooked investors.
3. **Solar Overcapacity Fears**: The market worries about overproduction, but Xinyi has maintained profitability and margins.

  
**Risks to Consider ⚠️**

* **Geopolitics**: Further U.S. tariffs or trade issues could weigh on sentiment, though Xinyi’s business is regionally focused.
* **Liquidity**: As an OTC stock, trading volume is low, increasing volatility.
* **Market Sentiment**: Negative views on China-related equities can suppress valuation, even if fundamentals are strong.

**The Opportunity**

With solid fundamentals, steady dividends, and an absurdly low valuation, Xinyi Solar could be a mispriced opportunity for value investors. While the risks are real, the financials tell a different story: growth, cash flow, and income stability.

**Questions for the Community:**

1. Do you see undervaluation here, or are the macro risks too significant?
2. How much weight should we place on China-specific fears for regionally focused companies?
3. Are there other solar sector plays that provide similar value with lower risk?

&lt;p&gt;With solid fundamentals, steady dividends, and an absurdly low valuation, Xinyi Solar could be a mispriced opportunity for value investors. While the risks are real, the financials tell a different story: growth, cash flow, and income stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for the Community:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you see undervaluation here, or are the macro risks too significant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much weight should we place on China-specific fears for regionally focused companies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there other solar sector plays that provide similar value with lower risk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

,stocks,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron:

Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year.

Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter.

Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025.

Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications.

In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory.

Currently, 69% of Micron's revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron's revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved.

Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space.

My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months.

In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning.

,stocks,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued.

The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it&amp;#39;s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The scalability myth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it&amp;#39;s vastly overvalued.  &lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

1. Investors were rattled by the CFO/COO's exit, with the company offering little explanation for the departure. However, given that Michael had been with the company since 2015, it seems his exit was well-planned. He sold only 5,000 shares while still holding a significant amount.
2. MongoDB (MDB) has seen an upward trend over the last few months, increasing from $231 in September to $355 by December, prompting some investors to take profits.
3. There was an expectation for a more ambitious forecast for the Atlas platform, which focuses on generating recurring revenue. Nevertheless, the future looks promising for MDB.

**MDB is forecasting stronger Q1 and beyond**

1. The company provided a stronger forecast than expected, projecting $517 million against the anticipated $509 million.
2. Overall, revenue is on an upward trajectory, margins are either stable or improving, cash flow is positive, the balance sheet is getting stronger, and future guidance has been enhanced.
3. The Price to Sales (P/S) ratio has been normalizing: from 20 in Q2'23, down to 16 in Q3'23, and now at 10/11. 
4. The Price to Book (P/B) ratio has also decreased from 34 in Q2'23 to 25 in Q3'23, and currently stands at 14.
5. There's a growing demand for AI applications that require document and distributed models, areas where MongoDB excels. Enterprises are also looking to modernize their legacy applications for analytics, and MongoDB is one of the few platforms capable of aiding in this transition.
6. CEO – “We continue to see success winning new business due to the superiority of MongoDB's developer data platform in addressing a wide variety of mission-critical use cases,..""

Cagrisema:
If they show 25 % weight loss with an okay side effect profile they will have the top of the class drug, which probably will shift momentum in the stock positively. They also just confirmed the full buy of Catalant yesterday. These two things in combination makes a santa rally of 10-20 % possible. Tomorrow we will see an increase of 5-10 % in stock is my guess because of Catalant. And my guess is that the Cagrisema data will be presented during the upcoming week.


They will have many more triggers in the coming time:

Novo Nordisk is expected to present its financial targets for 2025 at the beginning of February, which is important to monitor. 
This should be seen in light of the fact that CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen recently stated during an investor call that, from a mathematical perspective, growth could be expected to land in the “high teens” for the coming year, corresponding to around 17–19%. But the market probably expects a bit more, but if they see much higher growth than that it could significantly move the stock, depending on where revenue growth is anticipated to. Plus the strong dollar would positively influence Novos revenue.

During 2025, Novo Nordisk is expected to present new data – and possibly information about regulatory approval – regarding the oral version of semaglutide, which is essentially Wegovy in pill form.
The oral version of semaglutide demonstrated a 17% weight loss in a 68-week study, matching the results of the Wegovy injection.

In addition to weight-loss medications in pill form, attention may also turn to semaglutide’s effects on Alzheimer’s disease and much more.

Novo has always guided quite conservatively and they are the ones themselves who has communicated that they expect around 25 % weight loss on Cagrisema, so it would surprise me if the data is worse than that. If 23 % expect 10-15 % drawdown in the stock shortterm.

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

The latest report showed a 5% increase in revenues, but the profits were a bit weaker than expected. A big part of the dip seems to stem from concerns about slower growth – competition is rising, and stricter regulations could impact things in the short term.

For those who aren't familiar, Evolution AB is a leading company in the online gambling space, specializing in live casino solutions. They operate platforms like Evolution Gaming and NetEnt, offering live dealer games to online casinos. They’ve been incredibly successful in dominating the live casino market, with a strong presence in Europe and significant expansion in North America and Asia.

Looking ahead, I still think the company has a solid long-term outlook. Despite short-term challenges, Evolution continues to innovate, and its market leadership in live casino gaming remains strong. They’re also tapping into emerging markets, which could fuel growth moving forward.

So, should you buy now? If you're a long-term investor and can handle some short-term volatility, this could be a good opportunity to buy the dip. But if you’re looking for quick returns, it might be better to wait and see if the stock drops even further.

Strong Market Position: Lantheus is in the radiopharmaceutical market, particularly in the diagnostic imaging segment.

Product Pipeline: The company has a promising pipeline of innovative products, including PYLARIFY and PYLCLARI, which could drive future growth.

Financial Performance: The company has demonstrated strong financial performance, with increasing revenue and profitability in recent years.


Weaknesses of LNTH:

Dependency on Key Products: A significant portion of Lantheus' revenue is derived from a few key products. Any decline in sales or competition for these products could impact the company's financial performance.

,stocks,"As a longtime Broadcom investor, I am very pleased with its fourth quarter and full year FY2024 results.

QUARTERLY REVENUE: Broadcom achieved record revenues of $14.05 billion, up 51% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.

Artificial Intelligence Revenue: full year revenue reached $12.2 billion, up 220% year-over-year, far outperforming market expectations.

Free cash flow: reached $5.5 billion, or 39% of revenue, demonstrating strong profitability.

Gross margin: maintained at a high level of 77%, further demonstrating its efficient operating model and strong market position.

VMware Acquisitions and Growth Potential

The integration of VMware has been significant and has had an immediate and profound impact on Broadcom is profitability:

Software revenues: nearly doubled from $2.8 billion to $5.8 billion since the acquisition.

High Gross Margins: Gross margins in the software business are as high as 90%, which provides the company with ample cash flow and sets the stage for future expansion and return to shareholders.

From my perspective, VMware is integration not only improves operational efficiency, but also provides solid support for further growth in FY2025.

Leadership in AI infrastructure

Broadcom is performance in AI gives me confidence in its future:

Core products: Broadcom is custom AI gas pedals, Ethernet switches and optical transceivers continue to lead the market, meeting strong demand in the data center and cloud computing markets.

Revenue drivers: High growth in AI-related businesses further solidifies Broadcom is leadership in AI infrastructure.

Broadcom is outlook for Q1 2025 makes me even more optimistic about its future:

Revenue forecast: expected to reach $14.6 billion, up 22% YoY and 4% sequentially.

EBITDA forecast: expected to be $9.64 billion, with continued industry-leading margins.

Shareholder returns: Dividend increased 11% to $0.59 per share and payout ratio lowered to 0.50, demonstrating free cash flow growth potential.

Customer Diversification: Despite Apple's plans to reduce its reliance on Broadcom's Wi-Fi + Bluetooth chips, I'm confident that Broadcom is new AI gas pedal partnership agreement with Apple will more than offset the potential impact.

Risk diversification: Broadcom is business spans multiple sectors, including AI, software, wireless and networking, greatly reducing the risk of dependence on a single customer.

As a long-time tech stock investor, I think Broadcom is impressive performance in AI, data centers, and software, combined with efficient management and strategic acquisitions, make its long-term growth prospects very solid.

Its excellent margins and strong cash flow performance reduce investment risk, and I think Broadcom offers a good risk-reward ratio.

From my perspective, Broadcom is a quality stock to buy and hold for the long term.

Broadcom has demonstrated strong profitability and potential for continued growth with its leadership position in artificial intelligence and software, as well as synergies from the VMware integration. Although there is some uncertainty in the external market environment, Broadcom is diversified business structure and efficient operational management give me confidence in its future.

,stocks,"Costco on Thursday beat Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and sales estimates, as it got a boost in part from higher membership fees.

Here’s how the warehouse club did for the fiscal first quarter compared to what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: $4.04 vs. $3.79 expected
* Revenue: $62.15 billion vs. $62.08 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Nov. 24, Costco’s net income rose to $1.80 billion, or 4.04 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.58 per share in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $57.80 billion in the year-ago period.

Costco has benefitted from its reputation for selling bulk items at better value, as U.S. households feel the cumulative effect of higher food and housing prices. The membership-based club also hiked its annual membership fee for the first time in about seven years. The quarterly results are the first Costco has reported since that fee increase took effect in September.

Costco’s membership fees came in at $1.17 billion, compared to the $1.16 billion Wall Street had expected.

As of Thursday’s close, share of Costco are up nearly 50% so far this year, surpassing the 27% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same time period. Shares closed at $988.39 on Thursday.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

,stocks,"Adobe shares fell 14% on Thursday, their steepest drop since September 2022, after the software vendor issued disappointing revenue guidance.

Sales in the fiscal first quarter will be between $5.63 billion and $5.68 billion, Adobe said in its fourth-quarter earnings report late Wednesday. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.73 billion, according to LSEG.

Analysts at TD Cowen downgraded the stock to hold from buy, while Wells Fargo kept its buy rating following what it called a “frustrating ’24” for the company. The stock is now down 20% for the year, badly trailing the Nasdaq, which is up 33% and crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday.

While Adobe’s forecast trailed estimates, the company’s fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.81, topping the average analyst estimate of $4.66, according to LSEG. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $5.61 billion, beating the average estimate of $5.54 billion.

Monetizing generative artificial intelligence, especially in stand-alone offerings such as Firefly image generation or additional offerings across the Creative Cloud, has been central to Adobe’s growth strategy.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank maintained their buy rating but lowered their target price from $650 to $600.

“These results and guidance require a bit of faith in the full year next year,” the analysts wrote. Still, they said, “We see tangible evidence that Adobe is one of few application software companies in our coverage successfully monetizing generative AI today.”

Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

,stocks,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a core driver of the modern economy, and I am increasingly seeing its far-reaching impact across a wide range of industries. As someone who cares about investment opportunities, I see great potential in investing in AI-related companies, especially those that are leaders in technology, business model and market share. Of the many choices, there are two companies in particular that I favor and believe can help investors grow their wealth: Nvidia and Palantir Technologies

Nvidia is the leader in AI hardware and has been a mainstay in high-performance computing and deep learning. I've been impressed with the technical strength of its GPUs, which are used in a wide range of applications such as data centers, cloud computing, autonomous driving, and generative AI. As the demand for computing power for generative AI applications like ChatGPT explodes, I'm confident that demand for Nvidia's products will soar even further

In 2023, Nvidia's data center business saw record revenues and demonstrated technology leadership with its new H100 GPUs and Grace Hopper superchips. Combined with partnerships with cloud giants like AWS and Azure, I think Nvidia's market share will continue to grow. Analysts predict the generative AI market will reach nearly $100 billion over the next five years, and Nvidia will undoubtedly be a big part of that wave. I believe that holding the company's stock for the long term is expected to provide significant returns

Palantir's focus on data analytics and AI solutions gives me confidence in its market potential. The company offers the Gotham and Foundry platforms for government and enterprise, respectively, to help users extract value from large-scale data. I am particularly interested in Palantir's newly launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which combines generative AI technology to provide users with real-time data insights and decision support

On the financial front, Palantir has become profitable in 2023, which is an important turning point for a company. The company has also successfully expanded into emerging markets such as healthcare and energy, and has signed a long-term contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, further strengthening its revenue stream. I see more growth opportunities for Palantir in the future as the demand for data-driven decision-making in the enterprise grows

While both companies look promising, I also recognize that the AI industry is rapidly changing and that innovations from competitors can pose challenges. In addition, government regulation of AI could increase uncertainty, and the high valuations of these companies could lead to high volatility in their stock prices

For me, Nvidia and Palantir represent different opportunities for hardware and software in AI, with Nvidia dominating the infrastructure space with its hardware strengths and Palantir meeting the needs of enterprises and governments with its data analytics capabilities.

I am aware that folks at JP, Goldman, etc. with quant degrees know a lot more than I do. I'm just a lowly accountant. But we ain't talking active trading strategy here. This is about doing a little better than passive index, buy-n-hold. Well, that's why we login to Reddit, afterall.

**Context-2:** We've had 26% and 28% gains in S&amp;P in last two years. So, 2025 is likely to be a 'modest' year or a bad year.

Portfolio A: 100% in S&amp;P, e.g. $10,000

Portfolio B: 90% in cash (money market fund), 10% used to buy Dec-2025 call option, 10% OTM.

Portfolio C: 90% in cash (money market fund), 5% used to buy Jun-2025 call option, 5% OTM, repeated again mid-year, with Dec 2025 option.

^(Note: I've checked option prices, so the projected profits are reasonable correct. Cash return assumed at 4% ($360 on $9000).)

||Bullish scenario S&amp;P +10%|Boring year scenario, V shaped recovery|Bearish scenario, S&amp;P -10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A: 100% of $10,000 in S&amp;P|$1000 gain|$0 (took on market risk, suffered volatility). |\- $1000 |
|B: Cash + Option|$360 gain on cash + $2000 gain on the option. That Dec-2025 option expected to become 3X in bull market. This is a resonable assumption. Just see the option chain. |$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|
|C: Cash + multiple bullish option trades|$360 gain on cash + $3000 gain on the options. 4X jump on two options bought with $500. Note that these are only 5% OTM options, so this guy got lucky twice. Because, the distance to strike is less, gains are bigger. |$360 gain on cash + $1500 gain on only one option. 4X jump on one of the two options bought with $500.|Minus $640 - as above. |



**Conclusion**: Leaving 90% in cash/ money markets, and just buying affordable OTM Calls with far-out expiry, is more profitable and less volatile than the Booglehead way. This isn't a surprise, because effectively, you leverage (i.e. borrow) to play the market risk, without taking on full downside risk. This costs you, in terms of premium, and doesn't pay off in a boring, flat market (middle column in table above).

**Remark 1:** This 'strategy' is inspired from Nancy Pelosi. She is fond of buying December 2027 Calls in millions. Perhaps, her calls suffer temporary dips in short term, but when the thing plays out, she has 10X-ed her capital.

**Remark 2:** Aware that emergency funds should be separate from invested portfolio, but this $9000 cash could give the user a bit more peace of mind, because it stays as cash for full year, ready at fingertips, irrespective of the market conditions.

&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Boring year scenario, V shaped recovery&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;A: 100% of $10,000 in S&amp;amp;P&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$1000 gain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0 (took on market risk, suffered volatility).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;- $1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;B: Cash + Option&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $2000 gain on the option. That Dec-2025 option expected to become 3X in bull market. This is a resonable assumption. Just see the option chain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;C: Cash + multiple bullish option trades&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $3000 gain on the options. 4X jump on two options bought with $500. Note that these are only 5% OTM options, so this guy got lucky twice. Because, the distance to strike is less, gains are bigger.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $1500 gain on only one option. 4X jump on one of the two options bought with $500.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Minus $640 - as above.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Leaving 90% in cash/ money markets, and just buying affordable OTM Calls with far-out expiry, is more profitable and less volatile than the Booglehead way. This isn&amp;#39;t a surprise, because effectively, you leverage (i.e. borrow) to play the market risk, without taking on full downside risk. This costs you, in terms of premium, and doesn&amp;#39;t pay off in a boring, flat market (middle column in table above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 1:&lt;/strong&gt; This &amp;#39;strategy&amp;#39; is inspired from Nancy Pelosi. She is fond of buying December 2027 Calls in millions. Perhaps, her calls suffer temporary dips in short term, but when the thing plays out, she has 10X-ed her capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Aware that emergency funds should be separate from invested portfolio, but this $9000 cash could give the user a bit more peace of mind, because it stays as cash for full year, ready at fingertips, irrespective of the market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

Tesla’s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump’s election victory early last month. The stock’s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.

Musk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.

The world’s richest person, who’s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies’ budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level.

“The stock is responding to the Trump bump,” Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that “Musk’s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla’s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.”

On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that “the market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.”

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.

Since Trump’s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.

Tesla’s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company’s shares plunged 29% in the first three months of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla’s core business, which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.

In its third-quarter earnings report in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” That forecast was ahead of analysts’ predictions.

,stocks,"Apple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.

Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple’s AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Wednesday updates also include Apple’s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.

&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"I’ve been closely monitoring UnitedHealth Group (UNH) recently, and I noticed it’s been under significant pressure, with the stock now hovering around $518, down nearly 3% today. Last week’s news regarding the tragic incident with the CEO definitely shook things up, but I’m wondering: is this selloff more of an emotional reaction than a reflection of the company’s fundamentals?

Here’s my breakdown of the situation and why I think this could be an opportunity for long-term investors:

- Trailing P/E is on the high side at 34.69, but the forward P/E is 17.89, much more reasonable and closer to sector averages.

- The PEG ratio is 1.47, which suggests a fair valuation given its growth prospects.

- Revenue grew +9.2% YoY in the most recent quarter, with net income up +3.66%.

- Dividend growth has been consistently strong, averaging over 20% annual increases since 2010. Current dividend yield sits at 1.6%, with room for future hikes given a payout ratio of ~52%.

- The stock tested support around $515 today and saw a slight bounce.

- VWAP is $526, so the stock is trading below its average price, indicating near-term bearish sentiment, but it could also mean a potential opportunity for buyers.

UNH remains the leader in the healthcare sector, a defensive industry with favorable long-term trends like an aging population and rising demand for healthcare services.
Analysts have a target price range of $580-$600, suggesting a potential upside of 10-15% from current levels.

Do you think this drop is more of an overreaction tied to recent news rather than a reflection of any real weakness in UNH’s business fundamentals? Could the stock test lower levels (e.g., $500), or is the $515 support a solid floor for a potential recovery?

So, what happens when a publicly traded company decides to go private at a buyout share price that is below my average buying price of the stock ( being a minority share holder)

1. Say for example, I bought 100 shares of one company @ 100 USD each, however now, it decides to go private through a share buyout @ 90 USD / share. Will I be forced out of my position at a realised loss? Also, what if the price / share climbs up to 120 / share at the time of privatisation? Would I get realised @ buyout price of 90 / share or trading price of 120/ share?

2. Now, just by the news release, the company currently trades @ 110 USD / share. Will it be better to sell all my holding @ a realised profit based on the euphoria of the proposal, or do I hold on to it and wait and watch whether the privatisation deal goes through or not, since I still believe that the company has a moat in the industry it is in and I trust it’s longer term success. 

3. Considering point 2 above, would it make any sense to sell the shares now to lock in the profit and just in case the privatisation deal doesn’t happen for any reason, euphoria “might” fade and company price “could” trade @ a price below my existing average, then I could just buy back into the company story at a lower average price as it is currently trading @ higher multiples to earnings.

Oracle: strong growth, attractive valuation



Oracle shares fell 6% to $178 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Monday. Nonetheless, its shares have doubled since the end of 2022. This share price decline is a natural market reaction to high expectations.



The earnings report showed good prospects for Oracle future growth. Quarterly revenue rose 8.6% year-on-year to $14.1 billion, with cloud revenue up 24% to $5.9 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue reaching a further $2.4 billion. Oracle is migrating customers from traditional data storage to its efficient AI-enabled services. Future third-quarter revenue is expected to grow 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate growth of up to 10%



Oracle cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than the industry average, and overall annual revenue growth is expected to remain above 10% going forward. Although AI-related investments will put pressure on margins in the short term, analysts expect its average annual earnings per share growth rate to reach 18% over the next four years. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months is significantly lower than the average for the U.S. software industry, but its growth outlook is much stronger and the stock has room for further upside



Teradyne: Robotics and Chip Testing



Shares of Teradyne, a $19 billion robotics and chip-testing equipment maker, are down about 27% from their summer high of $163.21, and currently stand at $120. A recent slowdown in capital spending by industrial customers has led to a deceleration in growth in its industrial business, but the long-term outlook remains positive



Sales in this segment are expected to recover as industrial customers resume investment in automation equipment. Meanwhile, growing demand for AI chips is driving increased demand for chip test equipment. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 5% to $737 million. The analysis predicts that the market in which Teradyne is located could reach $19 billion by the end of the century, with its industry position strong and only Tokyo-based Advantest as its main competitor



Analysts expect Teradyne revenue and earnings per share to grow to $4.1 billion and $5.99, respectively, by 2026. If the company proves to be on a good trajectory, shares are expected to rally. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently 28 times, down from a yearly high of 37 times



AMD: The AI chip chaser



AMD shares fell 39% to $127 from a high of $227.30 in March as AI chip sales missed expectations. However, the company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $5 billion from $4.5 billion



AMD CEO Zifeng Su said the long-term size of the AI chip market could exceed $500 billion. NVIDIA currently occupies a $100 billion market, but customers still need to diversify their supply chains, and AMD is the second-biggest option after NVIDIA



Analysts expect AMD annual sales of data center chips, including AI chips, to grow 36% to $31 billion by 2027. A lower price-to-earnings ratio (26x vs. Nvidia 33x) also provides upside to its stock price



These three companies are uniquely positioned for long-term growth potential in the AI wave, and may be worth considering as a “second tier” for investors who missed Nvidia surge

I’m doing some research into Commvault’s stock and over the past few years, its performance has been great. I have been in the Backup &amp; Recovery software industry for quite some time and in doing public research, it appears they are losing customers hand over fist. Additionally, their software is incredibly complex but strive where others cannot backup bare metal workloads. I will say, the one good thing going for them is ability to protect AHV and Hyper-V hypervisors, but so can Rubrik and Cohesity, which are much more superior products - especially Rubrik. Commvault is like a better version of EMC’s Networker, which is incredibly legacy. Most people love Commvault for the good quality support (which makes the worlds different in the DPS industry). They announced they are moving Tier 1 support overseas and no longer using U.S employees. That will have major implications on successful future renewals. They purchased Clumio, which does AWS native backups (mainly for M365, which most companies don’t seem to care about - not talking about Fortune 500 companies or Healthcare organizations). Even with Clumio, isn’t Druva a much better platform for this? Rubrik just announced earnings and beat expectations by 48%, mainly attributed to new customers (many of which came from CVLT). 

I am struggling to understand why the street is so bullish on the stock. Wouldn’t this be a clear short? I cannot wrap my head around the fact that CVLT’s short interest is only 2% (12/11/24). 

Appreciate any advice or general thoughts on this.

&gt; President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. He will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars’ worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior. Ferguson is already one of the FTC’s five commissioners, which is currently made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. “Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, “Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.”

&gt; The replacement of Khan likely means that the FTC will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions. “These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,” wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland &amp; Knight, in a recent analysis.

&gt; Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country’s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night. Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC’s efforts to block the deal, some experts have said. And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior.

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

This development has prompted both the U.S. government and private industry to shift focus toward securing domestic supplies of antimony, and Perpetua Resources stands in a favorable position to meet this demand.

This situation increases the urgency for the **Stibnite Gold Project** in Idaho, as it could become a key source of both antimony and gold. As the U.S. government seeks to diversify its critical mineral supply chains, Perpetua’s potential to fill this gap has garnered increased attention from investors and policymakers alike.

**The Role of Antimony in Spacecraft Technology**

Antimony plays a key role in space technology due to its unique properties, such as flame resistance, high thermal stability, and its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of electronic systems. In spacecraft, antimony is commonly used in **soldering alloys** for electronics, **batteries**, and **semiconductors** that are essential for power management and communication systems. Additionally, its flame-retardant qualities make it useful in materials designed for **thermal protection** and **heat shields**. Notable space companies like **NASA**, **SpaceX**, **Lockheed Martin**, and **Boeing** are likely to use antimony-based compounds in various spacecraft components. For example, SpaceX's **Dragon spacecraft** and **Starship** incorporate antimony in their **electronics** and **batteries**, while Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and MDA Space with their work on **satellites** and **space exploration missions**, rely on antimony-enhanced alloys for structural and electronic components. These materials are essential in ensuring the durability and reliability of spacecraft as they endure the extreme conditions of space.

**What’s Happening with the ROD?**

The **Record of Decision (ROD)** is the final approval needed from the U.S. Forest Service for the Stibnite Gold Project to proceed with its development. The ROD marks the end of a lengthy environmental review process and the beginning of the company’s construction and operational phases. This decision is expected to come soon, end of year—meaning we are very close to a major turning point for Perpetua Resources:

**The 45-Day Time Window**

The ROD is required to be issued within **45 days** of the U.S. Forest Service’s publication of the **Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)**. The FEIS was published in October 26^(th) 2024, putting the deadline for the ROD around  **5 December 2024**. This time frame is critical, as it sets the stage for the next steps in the project’s development. Investors are watching closely, knowing that the issuance of the ROD could lead to a surge in stock price, as it would signify a major regulatory victory for the company.

**What Does This Mean for Investors?**

The upcoming **ROD** could have major implications for Perpetua Resources' stock. If the decision is favorable (and considering china's ban on antimony, this is practically a given, together with the emerging space race), the company will have the green light to move ahead with construction, which could lead to long-term value creation. Investors may see this as a bullish signal, potentially driving the stock price higher in anticipation of future production.

Given the critical role that antimony plays in the U.S. economy and the political backing of domestic projects, Perpetua Resources is positioned to benefit from both its strategic project and increasing governmental focus on critical minerals. The involvement of John Paulson, with his close ties to Trump, may further support the company’s efforts to fast-track approvals and secure necessary financing. As the company moves closer to breaking ground, these factors could all converge to drive significant value for investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for U.S.-sourced antimony.

With the &lt;strong&gt;Record of Decision (ROD)&lt;/strong&gt; expected any day now, PPTA’s stock could see significant movement depending on how the situation unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"General Motors said Tuesday that it will no longer fund robotaxi development work by Cruise citing “capital allocation priorities,” and “the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.”

The Detroit automaker plans to “realign its autonomous driving strategy” to focus on advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous systems for use in personal vehicles instead, and it will combine the majority-owned Cruise LLC and GM technical teams.

This summer, the Detroit automaker said it would indefinitely delay production of the Origin autonomous vehicle as its Cruise self-driving unit attempted to relaunch operations. At that point, Cruise began to focus on using the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt for development of autonomous vehicles since then.

In the U.S. Alphabet-owned Waymo has begun to operate commercial robotaxi services across several major metro areas while GM-owned Cruise has faltered. Chinese autonomous vehicle makers including Pony.ai and WeRide have rolled out in overseas markets as well.

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab at an event in October. Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its autonomous vehicles, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities including San Francisco.

,stocks,"Oracle shares dropped 8% on Tuesday and headed for their steepest decline in a year following the database software vendor’s disappointing earnings report.

The stock’s worst day of the year had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 68% in 2024, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999.

After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate.

Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue.

“A bit of a stumble here for a stock that’s created some lofty expectations for itself,” wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said “we still like oracle heading into 2025.”

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57.

Oracle’s biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers.  
  
The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.  
  
Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models.

“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world’s most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,” Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement.

Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 “based on continued cloud momentum.” They cited Oracle’s cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen &amp; Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company&amp;#39;s operations are global. The only geographical &amp;#39;risk&amp;#39; is, you&amp;#39;ve a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It&amp;#39;s all about winning a large government / private contracts.&lt;/li&gt;

,stocks,"&gt;Alphabet's Google, along with TPG Rise Climate and other investors, is backing clean energy developer Intersect Power as part more than $800 million funding round, the company said on Tuesday.

&gt;By building data centers next to purpose-built, carbon-free energy sources, Google aims to ease power grid constraints and reduce delivery timelines for both power generation and data center projects.

&gt;Google will be a main customer for the clean energy produced by Intersect Power's new facilities and will open new data centers that use this clean energy right away, the company said.

,stocks,"Shares of Walgreens jumped about 20% on Tuesday on a report that the company is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. 

Walgreens and Sycamore have been discussing a deal that could be completed early next year, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. New York-based Sycamore would likely sell off pieces of Walgreens’ business or work with partners, the Journal reported.

A Walgreens spokesperson declined to comment on the reported talks.

The report comes during a rough period for the retail pharmacy giant. The company’s stock was down more than 60% for the year before its climb Tuesday.

Walgreens — squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, a leadership shakeup, pharmacy reimbursement headwinds and its wobbly push into health care — has underperformed Wall Street’s earnings expectations for two straight quarters. Walgreens’ pharmacy business in particular has been flailing due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and several factors pressuring the front of the store, such as inflation and increased competition.

The company is trying to regain its footing with a new CEO, health-care industry veteran Tim Wentworth. Since stepping into the role in October 2023, Wentworth has moved to slash costs at Walgreens.

In October, Walgreens said it plans to close roughly 1,200 of its drugstores over the next three years, including 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. Walgreens has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable. The company has also scaled back its push into primary care by cutting its stake in primary care provider VillageMD. 

Walgreens has reportedly been seen as a potential private equity target in the past. 

In 2019, private equity firm KKR made a roughly $70 billion buyout offer to the company, the Financial Times and Bloomberg reported at the time.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

,stocks,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.

,stocks,"Nvidia shares were under pressure Monday after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the chipmaker over possible violations to the country’s antimonopoly law.

Shares slipped about 2% before the bell.

The State Administration for Market Regulation opened an investigation into the chipmaker in relation to acquisition of Mellanox, the Chinese government said Monday.

“In recent days, due to Nvidia’s suspected violation of China’s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation’s restrictive conditions around Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox shares ... the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law,” according to a statement translated by CNBC.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers.

The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations.

Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"I know after recent CEO firings, sentiment is low right now. But usually the best bargains are when investors are fearful. Not financial advice.

Intel has been one of the worst performing stocks in the last several years. They just got rid of a CEO, their foundries have not been up to the task, they are severely behind Nvidia and AMD in AI sector with GPUs, they have reported poor earnings, and their consumer CPUs and wafers have been getting railroaded by AMD and TSMC. 

However, I believe now is the best time to invest. 

I believe things are finally starting to turn ship for Intel. For example - 

* Their 18As have been getting decent yields despite the biased reporting, and look promising. Sure, TSMC is still their biggest rival and ahead of Intel, but Intel can catch up. If they can pluck a few talents from TSMC, or invest greater in their R&amp;D, with US govt chip money backing them, it's possible.
* US government has a vested interest is not letting Intel to fail - it's a geopolitical issue to have cutting edge processor technology in US. If US continues to pump money into Intel just like Taiwan has done for TSMC, Intel can afford to expand its foundries and research cutting edge tech.
* Intel's new Battlemage GPUs seem really cost efficient and there is strong positive sentiment. They will start to gobble up more marketshare and absorb more of Nvidia's AI market as Intel's technology grows in the next gen. This is huge. Nvidia's marketcap is so big that if Intel even eats a bit of the AI market, it will grow exponentially. 
   * Intel's GPU technology looks already promising seeing how they are catching up in drivers and software, and their XeSS technology is ALREADY better than AMD's FSR. 
* They have been getting leaner with mass layoffs and shutting down European plants, and recently reported sell-to-lease transactions. They are cutting costs where they can. 
* Their recent mobile chips - Lunar Lake, have performed fantastic, with high performance and low wattage (which is critical for laptops that suffer under high heat). 

Additionally, if China invades Taiwan, Intel instantly will skyrocket overnight.

,stocks,"“Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.

“My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,” Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.

Bezos’s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

One of the cornerstone projects under Bezos’s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon’s AI capabilities.

Although Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon’s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.

“I’ll always be there to help, and right now, I’m putting a lot of time into it,” Bezos said. “It’s super interesting, so why not?”

Amazon’s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.

Bezos’s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon’s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company’s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.

Bezos’s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon’s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos’s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.”

&gt;Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE: IPG) (“Interpublic”) today announced their Boards of Directors have unanimously approved a definitive agreement pursuant to which Omnicom will acquire Interpublic in a stock-for-stock transaction. The combined company will bring together the industry’s deepest bench of marketing talent, and the broadest and most innovative services and products, driven by the most advanced sales and marketing platform. Together, the companies will expand their capacity to create comprehensive full-funnel solutions that deliver better outcomes for the world’s most sophisticated clients.

&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Interpublic shareholders will receive 0.344 Omnicom shares for each share of Interpublic common stock they own. Following the close of the transaction, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and Interpublic shareholders will own 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. The transaction is expected to generate annual cost synergies of $750 million.

&lt;p&gt;Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

The combined company will bring together the industry’s deepest bench of marketing talent, and the broadest and most innovative services and products, driven by the most advanced sales and marketing platform. Together, the companies will expand their capacity to create comprehensive full-funnel solutions that deliver better outcomes for the world’s most sophisticated clients.&lt;/p&gt;

The transaction is expected to generate annual cost synergies of $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Finding value in this market seems near impossible. But, I think I may have found a cigar butt — Office Depot. Here’s my back of the envelope math that I’m hoping y’all can help fill out a little more. This is just a primer to get the convo flowing. Please keep it civil, factual, and support assertions with numbers/facts. Please. 

In 2015 staples tried to purchased Office Depot for $6.3b, but the deal was killed by the FTC. They tried again in 2021 offering $2.1b. This got me wondering, why? Where’s the value? Well, there may be a little. 

ODP is comprised of Four business units: 1) ODP Business Solutions, LLC (B2B); 2) Office Depot, LLC (retail); 3) Veyer, LLC (logistics); and 4) Varis, Inc. (digital procurement). 

 The latter 2 are interesting and showed  decent growth: Veyer (25%) and Varis (14%). ODP “sold” most of Varis but still owns about 20%. They actually paid the buyer to take it off their hands (this plays a small role in my broader thesis of why ODP NEEDS to sell, the leadership is totally incompetent). 

The company is shrinking, and rapidly. But they have $181mm in cash. Net income of $139mm. Receivables are $487mm. Inventory $765mm. They own real estate that’s worth about $86mm (but hard to confirm). $1.04B in debt. Total liabilities of 2.785B. Current market cap is $779mm. 

Removing debt from the equation, conservatively I put the value around $1.1b. That’s a 41% delta/upside. 

But, factoring in debt, it’s a different picture (obviously). They’ve manage to decrease their interest expense every year, going from $89mm in 2019 to $20mm in 2023. They recently restructured their revolver and the new maturity date is 2029, so they have time. There’s also a $250mm accordion allowing them to increase the loan from $800mm to $1.05b. 

The logistics component (veyer) seems interesting and promising but it sounds like they’re unhappy with the performance there as well — again just really poor management. 

EBITDA: $417mm
Adjusted: $131mm

,stocks,"I decided to explore this by testing three different strategies for contributing funds to a portfolio over 10 years to try to determine whether it's better to invest a lump sum at the start of the year, spread contributions evenly across months, or invest incrementally each trading day. Here's how it played out.

**The Strategies**

1. **Yearly Lump Sum**: Investing $10,000 at the beginning of each year.
2. **Monthly Investment**: Breaking $10,000 into 12 equal parts ($833.33) and investing at the start of each month.
3. **Daily Investment**: Spreading $10,000 evenly across all trading days in a year.

**Overall Results (End of 2024)**

* **Yearly Lump Sum**: $53,461, with an overall cumulative return of **\~434.6%**.
* **Monthly Investment**: $51,435, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.4%**.
* **Daily Investment**: $51,446, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.5%**.

After conducting a 20-year test comparing three popular investment strategies—lump-sum investing, monthly contributions, and daily contributions—I found that the yearly lump-sum strategy provided the highest overall returns. At first glance, this might seem like a definitive answer to the perennial question of how to invest for the best outcome. But the more I analyzed the results, the more I began to question whether the data truly tells the whole story.

EDIT:

my resaerch was completely wrong and goes to show that AI is only as good as the data that you put into it. These are the final results after some tweaks:  
  
**Yearly Lump Sum**: $163,573.96

**Monthly Investment:** $180,559.47

**Weekly Investment:** $182,003.40

**Daily Investment:** $131,120.43

	•	In Q3 2024, CLOV reported a significant improvement in financial metrics:
	•	Adjusted EBITDA increased to $19.3M, up from $2.7M year-over-year.
	•	Insurance revenue rose 7% to $322.6M 
	•	The company raised its full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $55-65M, signaling confidence in profitability and growth 
	2.	Technical Indicators:
	•	Recent trading patterns suggest a potential reversal from a downtrend. Articles mention a “hammer chart pattern,” which indicates that selling pressure (from “bears”) may be weakening, potentially giving way to buying momentum (from “bulls”) 
	3.	Strategic Advancements:
	•	CLOV achieved a 4.0-star rating for its flagship PPO plan, improving competitiveness and allowing for higher reimbursement rates from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 

Competitors and Similar Companies:

CLOV competes with other Medicare Advantage providers and health-tech-driven insurance companies like Humana (HUM), Alignment Healthcare (ALHC), and Oscar Health (OSCR).
	•	Humana, a larger player, has shown steady growth but operates at a different scale.
	•	Smaller competitors like Alignment Healthcare have also faced challenges similar to CLOV in maintaining profitability, with mixed stock performance in 2024.

Current Stock Performance:

CLOV has experienced significant volatility in 2024, with bears dominating earlier in the year. However, improved earnings, technical indicators, and bullish sentiment have made it a candidate for speculative recovery. It is still priced below many competitors, appealing to value-oriented investors

Conclusion:

Clover Health’s focus on leveraging technology for healthcare innovation and its financial turnaround make it a speculative buy for those willing to bet on its continued recovery and market positioning.

Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals.

The Composite Growth Strategy

The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition:

	1.	Growth Per Share
Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly.

	2.	Absolute Growth
Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance.

	3.	Creditworthiness
Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales.

	4.	Low Dilution
Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares.

	5.	Intangible Monetization
Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow.

	6.	Retained ROIC Composite
Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value.

	7.	Raw ROIC Composite
Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income.

	8.	Shareholder Payout
Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time.

Backtesting Results

To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

The results demonstrated a clear trend:

	•	The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.

	•	Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.

	•	Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased.

Chart in link below

This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.

Final Thoughts

This strategy was born from the idea of treating stock selection with the same rigor as buying a private business. By focusing on fundamental metrics like growth, ROIC, and shareholder payouts, it aims to identify companies that compound value over time.

,stocks,"First let’s get this out the way, Wayfair did see a 30% jump last month, I think this is moreso in anticipation of lowering rates, as of Q3 this yr Wayfair is still reporting a loss currently, I still think they have room to grow.

We don’t need to dive into this piece too deep, but if rates were to lower from highs which they inevitably will home buying goes up and so too does purchases for furniture. Even if there’s customers that think Wayfair is cheap it’s hard to say that they won’t see growth in revenue. So we know revenue will likely grow, which is great but there’s still a negative bottom line.

Wayfair management recently announced some sort of “loyalty program”. You pay an annual fee and you get discounts (which in a scenario where there’s tariffs that raise prices this might help offset some of those costs to the customer). On a surface level you would think this would hurt bottom lines, but there’s a few catches with this. 

For one, management expects those loyal customers who buy an average of two pieces a year will increase to 3 pieces a year, additionally, with 40% of gross profit being spent on advertising, they think they can cut costs by limiting ads where maybe it doesn’t show to a loyal customer who visits Wayfair anyways when looking for furniture. Lastly it’s a small revenue driver but at $29/year the membership cost is so low where it makes that decision to buy a membership that much easier. 

I like the idea since it seems like it’s trying to tackle an efficiency problem in their spending, and tariff wise could offset SOME of the price increases that may make a customer think twice about a purchase. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Does this stock have more to drop, and do you think this idea could work?

,stocks,"""Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE: BAH) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) jointly announced today a groundbreaking co-creation partnership to accelerate defense mission innovation and help the U.S. maintain superiority against its adversaries.

""America is facing the most challenging national security environment in half a century, and we need to move faster to address these challenges. Combatting our adversaries requires change—starting with activating a whole-of-nation approach that accelerates results, pushes boundaries, and disrupts long-standing barriers,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman, CEO, and president of Booz Allen.

“We have seen the positive results of embracing this type of change already,” continued Rozanski. “By working together, Alex and I are creating new mission capabilities that leverage Palantir’s and Booz Allen’s unique technologies and expertise to close mission gaps at the speed of now. Our joint team created a prototype in only 45 days.”

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But growth stocks don&amp;#39;t rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp;amp; revenue.  You&amp;#39;ll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

After spending good amount of time talking about their 'AI Studio', there isn't  a very direct answer on FCF either, in their Earnings call:

Brent Bracelin

&gt; Helpful color there, Sonalee for you. I know it's early and really look forward to hearing more about the cost rationalization plan, but you do have a bogey here for Q4. Can you walk us through the path to positive free cash flow? I asked because there was an $18 million burn here in Q3 and I'm just trying to think through the rationalization and ability to get to positive free cash flow here in Q4.

Sonalee Parekh, CFO Asana

&gt; Yes, sure. So as you saw, there was some positive movement on sales and marketing and R&amp;D spend in the current quarter. And part of that actually was due to the timing of some of our hiring. But we do expect to get a continued benefit there, again in terms of timing of hires, which is helpful. And then secondly, there are steps we've already started taking around some rationalization of spend, third party spend, which you should see come into Q4. But what I would really urge you to do is Q4. We've reiterated the positive free cash flow, but I think where you'll really start to see the meaningful improvements in operating margin and cash flow is as you look ahead to next year, where we'll provide more detail in March.

Dustin Moskovitz, CEO

&gt; And this is Dustin. I just wanted to add on to that. I mean, we're really looking at, free cash flow is always a little bit lumpy. So we're really looking at the progress on the operational leverage and how things trend from here into next year. So feel good about Q4, but the real goal is to build up a margin through next year, not to just arrive at the free cash flow.

&lt;p&gt;Dustin Moskovitz, CEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is Dustin. I just wanted to add on to that. I mean, we&amp;#39;re really looking at, free cash flow is always a little bit lumpy. So we&amp;#39;re really looking at the progress on the operational leverage and how things trend from here into next year. So feel good about Q4, but the real goal is to build up a margin through next year, not to just arrive at the free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

,stocks,"Hi,

I've been researching both of these companies and would like to hear some opinions from others.

NVO seems like the better company in terms of value, but LLY appears to have a broader portfolio of products, which makes me think their competitive advantage might be stronger.

1. Do you think LLY has a stronger competitive advantage?
2. Do you believe both companies have a strong competitive advantage?

Both companies seem very similar, which makes me wonder why LLY is valued so much higher than NVO. The only reasons I can think of are that LLY is an American company and focuses on a broader range of therapeutic areas. However, these factors don’t seem enough to justify such a significantly higher valuation compared to NVO.

I currently think NVO is the better company and investment.

What are your thoughts? Is LLY's higher valuation justified? Also, do you think investing in either of these companies is a good way to diversify into the medical sector?

,stocks,"Last night, Samsara Holdings (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.” 

  
**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.** 

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

  
The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!

Intapp is stock price has doubled since its IPO and is up more than 60% year-to-date, although the valuation still has a lot of upside

I note that the market for Intapp is services is huge, with a target market (TAM) of $46 billion, and the company currently has a market share of $500 million, which means it has a market share of about 1.1%. The company has demonstrated its strong growth potential by expanding its product portfolio and utilizing a low-code approach, attracting some of the top firms in the financial, legal and accounting industries as clients

Intapp is clients include well-known companies such as Lazard, Carlyle, and EY. The partnership with Microsoft, in particular, has been crucial for the company, as Intapp is software can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Azure marketplace and runs on the Azure platform. Microsoft's sales network also helps raise awareness of Intapp is products

I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company's net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion

In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year

Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years

Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position.

&lt;p&gt;I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company&amp;#39;s net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position. Therefore, I think the investment will be very profitable. Overall, Intapp shows very good risk-reward prospects&lt;/p&gt;

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Because it is a Roth, I don’t have any tax implications between shot term or long term.  

If I buy 5000k shares @$30 and then 
sell the 40c for 16Jan2026 for $9.50, 
I get $47.5k.  This is an immediate 
return of 31.66%.

rinse and repeat until I can’t buy 100 shares to sell a call against.  I end up 
with 7200 Shares with my initial investment of $150k.  I also have 72 contracts at the $40 strike.  So essentially I paid 20.83 per share.  

So for my investment to lose money the price would have to drop below $20.83 
which is the risk with this strategy.  On the other side if the price stays flat at $30 and contracts expire worthless.

44% return in just over a year.  If it does go up and shares are called away, then 
my account is now $288k or a 92%

Even if price drops 20% it would still be a 15% gain on original investment.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the third consecutive reduction and one that came with a cautionary tone about additional reductions in coming years. 

In a move widely anticipated by markets, the Federal Open Market Committee cut its overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, back to the level where it was in December 2022 when rates were on the move higher. 

Though there was little intrigue over the decision itself, the main question had been over what the Fed would signal about its future intentions as inflation holds steadily above target and economic growth is fairly solid, conditions that don’t normally coincide with policy easing. 

In delivering the 25 basis point cut, the Fed indicated that it probably would only lower twice more in 2025, according to the closely watched “dot plot” matrix of individual members’ future rate expectations. The two cuts indicated slice in half the committee’s intentions when the plot was last updated in September. 

Assuming quarter-point increments, officials indicated two more cuts in 2026 and another in 2027. Over the longer term, the committee sees the “neutral” funds rate at 3%, 0.1 percentage point higher than the September update as the level has drifted gradually higher this year. 

For the second consecutive meeting, one FOMC member dissented: Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wanted the Fed to maintain the previous rate. Governor Michelle Bowman voted no in November, the first time a governor voted against a rate decision since 2005. 

The fed funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but also influences a variety of consumer debt such as auto loans, credit cards and mortgages. 

The post-meeting statement changed little except for a tweak regarding the “extent and timing” of further rate changes, a slight language change from the November meeting. 

The cut came even through the committee jacked up its projection for full-year gross domestic product growth to 2.5%, half a percentage point higher than September. However, in the ensuing years the officials expect GDP to slow down to its long-term projection of 1.8%. 

Other changes to the Summary of Economic Projections saw the committee lower its expected unemployment rate this year to 4.2% while headline and core inflation according to the Fed’s preferred gauge also were pushed higher to respective estimates of 2.4% and 2.8%, slightly higher than the September estimate and above the Fed’s 2% goal. 

The committee’s decision comes with inflation not only holding above the central bank’s target but also while the economy is projected by the Atlanta Fed to grow at a 3.2% rate in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate has hovered around 4%. 

Though those conditions would be most consistent with the Fed hiking or holding rates in place, officials are wary of keeping rates too high and risking an unnecessary slowdown in the economy. Despite macro data to the contrary, a Fed report earlier this month noted that economic growth had only risen “slightly” in recent weeks, with signs of inflation waning and hiring slowing. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the rate cuts are an effort to recalibrate policy as it does not need to be as restrictive under the current conditions. 

With Wednesday’s move, the Fed will have cut benchmark rates by a full percentage point since September, a month during which it took the unusual step of lowering by a half point. The Fed generally likes to move up or down in smaller quarter-point increments as its weighs the impact of its actions. 

Despite the aggressive moves lower, markets have taken the opposite tack. 

Mortgage rates and Treasury yields both have risen sharply during the period, possibly indicating that markets do not believe the Fed will be able to cut much more. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury most recently yielded 4.215%, putting it in the upper range of the Fed’s rate move Wednesday.",t2_4daatxkf,False,,0,False,"Fed cuts by a quarter point, indicates fewer reductions ahead",[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1hh8x49,False,dark,0.98,,public,711,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,711,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1734548562.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Disclaimer: I am not a bagholder. I recently entered a position with a big part of my portfolio. I like to look at stocks where I think the market is mispricing risks and opportunities. I called for buying Alphabet in this sub in September and see a similar opportunity here (although not quite as strong).

1. Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19.

2. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price.

3. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.

4. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD.

5. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died.

6. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here.

7. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over.

8. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

,stocks,"If the alliance between Elon Musk and Donald Trump proves to be short-lived—which seems plausible given their mutual need to always be in the driver’s seat—and if the current Tesla rally is partially fueled by the perceived strength of their relationship, could this present a case for shorting Tesla? While there’s no direct tension yet, some news outlets have sarcastically referred to Musk as an 'unelected figure' eager to steal the spotlight, suggesting that his high-profile actions might overshadow others.

This raises the question: Is Tesla’s current rally driven by the perceived good relationship between Musk and Trump, or is it rooted in a genuine improvement in Tesla’s revenue outlook? If the rally is supported by a stronger business foundation, this speculative angle may hold little weight.

While there’s no direct tension yet, some news outlets have sarcastically referred to Musk as an &amp;#39;unelected figure&amp;#39; eager to steal the spotlight, suggesting that his high-profile actions might overshadow others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises the question: Is Tesla’s current rally driven by the perceived good relationship between Musk and Trump, or is it rooted in a genuine improvement in Tesla’s revenue outlook? If the rally is supported by a stronger business foundation, this speculative angle may hold little weight.

The semiconductor company reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.79, compared to Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $1.76, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $8.7 billion, which was in line with analysts’ expectations.

Micron’s outlook was weak, though. It guided the current quarter to $7.9 billion in sales, at the midpoint of its range, versus an $8.9 billion estimate from analysts.

“While consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a press release. “We continue to gain share in the highest margin and strategically important parts of the market and are exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.”

Micron shares were down as much as 17% in late trading following the report.

In management’s prepared remarks for the earnings call, the company blamed the outlook on a weaker-than-expected PC upgrade cycle. Management also saw softness in the auto and industrial markets.

Micron is a leader in the markets for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which is used in desktop computers and servers, and for flash memory, which is found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. It has also become a key supplier of HBM (high-bandwidth memory) for artificial intelligence servers.

I think AMD shares fell 5% last week despite being the leader in CPU (now that Intel is in trouble) and to a lesser extent GPU makers

I'm bullish on AMD for the following reasons

\-Replacement GPU are available on a budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand in the next few years

\-It's the best CPU for consumers and data centers, no doubt about it. and you need CPU to reason about AI models trained on GPU

\-The PC market will enter a 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with the end of Windows 10 support

\-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors

Before anyone says NVDA is 1000x better than AMD ......

I agree that AMD is not dominant in CUDA and that they are years behind NVDA in this area and may not even be close to catching up

I don't think AMD is “dead” in the consumer GPU space

I agree that most developers consider NVDA when developing games, but it's definitely a cheaper alternative to NVDA, especially in less affluent countries

I have reservations about what I'm going to say next - I think AMD is going to overshadow what's left of NVDA

Given AMD recent acquisitions, I also expect AMD to launch its own parallel computing platform.

I realize this is also an unlikely goal, but if demand surges, AMD may be considered for CUDA

I am fully invested in AMD because I think AMD is trading below its fair price

,stocks,"JNJ is currently trading at $146.4 per share, with a market capitalization of $352.49 billion. But the market may be overlooking its potential.

Several valuation models indicate JNJ is priced below its intrinsic value. Estimates range from a 31.7% to a 48.8% discount. Lemme break this down:  


* **Intrinsic Value Estimate:** $192.8 per share. This is based on a conservative growth outlook.
* **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model:** $217.9 per share. This calculation uses a 6.9% discount rate and a 3.0% long-term growth rate.
* **Relative Valuation:** $167.6 per share. Even using this method, which often shows lower values than intrinsic value models, JNJ shows upside potential. 



The consistency across these different valuation methods supports the conclusion of a price below fair value.  


Now, let's look at the financial picture. JNJ's last twelve months (LTM) free cash flow (FCF) was $19.5 billion, generated on LTM revenue of $87.7 billion. Its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin is 21.1%, slightly below its five-year average of 22.4%. However, the market appears to be pricing in a -2.8% annual decline in free cash flow over the next decade. This is in contrast to JNJ's three-year average FCF growth of 4.6% and the industry average of 8.2%. This discrepancy suggests the market's outlook may be too pessimistic.  


Projections for the next ten years (2024-2034) show:  


* Revenue growth from $88.7 billion to $130.3 billion (a 4.0% CAGR).
* Operating income (EBIT) increasing from $22.1 billion to $32.4 billion.
* Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) rising from $20.9 billion to $30.6 billion (a 2.3% CAGR). 

This projected growth is steady and reflects the stability often associated with established companies like JNJ. The market-implied value of growth (MIVoG) is 27.8% of enterprise value, suggesting the market may be underestimating its future growth potential.  


Based on my projections, expected annual returns are approximately 3.1% over three years and 6.8% over five years. These returns include projected earnings growth (3.7%), shareholder yield (4.0%), and a decrease in valuation multiples (-4.6%).

JNJ has a slightly high P/E ratio, yeah, but the price-to-value gap and strong cash flow generation make it an interesting stock to watch for. Overall score: 9 of 10, according to Value Sense.

,stocks,"I don't currently have a position, as I'm trying to figure out the best position to enter.

I'd like to share a short thesis for Carvana ($CVNA). I know there have been a few posts on Carvana outlining fraud or technical analysis on the more degenerate places on reddit but I'd like to present a more complete thesis that the Carvana implosion will happen in the next 8 to 13 months - perhaps less. It's really a question of when confidence in the company gets shot.

It may not be this upcoming earnings period but certainly could be the next. I'll be following CarMax closely as the press release announcing their earnings for this week a full 15 days early - never before has CarMax issued a press release for a standard earnings date before the quarter ended. CarMax's earnings beat/misses don't seem to correlate with Carvana's earnings beat/misses.

How do I know that Carvana is going to collapse? Because I read the bonds. Their free cash flow cannot cover the repayment scheme and their early payments are lipstick on a pig which have no meaningful effect. This was known when the deal was pushed through. I'm fairly certain that as Carvana went up and up and up people forgot some of those top line numbers and those dates.

The Bonds:

Tranche 1: 12.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2028

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 2: 13.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% or 11% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2030

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K. or 11% Cash (CVNA's discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 3: 14.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2031

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K.February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

A little translation: P.I.K. is Paid In Kind - basically added to the principle at that interest rate. That provides a fair amount of leeway for Carvana to kick the can down the road, however, that road ""ends"" on August 15th. In October/November's earnings they'll be forced to addressed the repayments which exceed their free cash flow. Or not. After that, on February 15th 2026 a whole lotta money is due and there's no way they can not address it in February's earnings call. Actually, there's little value in computing how much is due at those times because it simply cannot be repaid. Free cash flow for the last two quarters was around $600-$700m (total), and debt payments will be close to $220M or more in any 2 quarters - a full third of the (now) positive FCF. Carvana will not be able to buy cars to expand. And the chance of them doubling their free cash flow is slim - even as they eak out a slim profit.

I could only see Tranche 1 August payments they made last earnings as a token ""show of force"" - $100m prepayment is a drop in the bucket on $5-7B in debt and only trims the expected interest by virtually nothing. It also does explain why the executive team is bailing now - the farther out from these maturities they bail the less likely they could experience clawbacks for engaging in fraud (a'la Sears Roebuck &amp; Co - it's not fraud if it's being conducted openly and for a long time).

Since Caravana is split between Hold through Strong Buy, well, another reason not to trust analysts.

One missed earnings and this company is toast. Increased inflation and this company is toast. Tariffs may support Carvana more than I would like as used cars won't face tariffs, but inflation caused by labor deportations and increased COL from tariffs between Mexico and Canada will completely negate that - particularly if used car loan defaults go up (they are) and loan restrictions start going up (they are according to FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STDSAUTO)

The question is, is this the top? Long term LEAP puts are expensive-ish, but this company will be driven down to $3 within a few months of February - either before or after.

Update/Edit: I ran some interest only numbers which are in the discussion.  Long and the short, CVNA will have interest expenses of about $440M per-year when these convert to cash interest next year, up from interest expenses of $12.5M now.  They also have a $98M unsecured bond due in 2025, which they could possibly refinance or re-issue.  There free cash flow is increasing, from 2024Q1:$100M to 2024Q3: $400M.  However, this needs to be maintained - any economic shocks would still cripple their ability to repay their debt or buy cars.  An strict repayment only holds the debt steady at $5.2B - functionally turning Carvana into a Zombie Corp.  The can could be kicked down the road to 2028, but probably not if interest rates increase.  Interest rate increases or weakness in consumer subprime auto lending lasting longer than a quarter would cripple the company.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to share a short thesis for Carvana ($CVNA). I know there have been a few posts on Carvana outlining fraud or technical analysis on the more degenerate places on reddit but I&amp;#39;d like to present a more complete thesis that the Carvana implosion will happen in the next 8 to 13 months - perhaps less. It&amp;#39;s really a question of when confidence in the company gets shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not be this upcoming earnings period but certainly could be the next. I&amp;#39;ll be following CarMax closely as the press release announcing their earnings for this week a full 15 days early - never before has CarMax issued a press release for a standard earnings date before the quarter ended. CarMax&amp;#39;s earnings beat/misses don&amp;#39;t seem to correlate with Carvana&amp;#39;s earnings beat/misses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know that Carvana is going to collapse? Because I read the bonds. Their free cash flow cannot cover the repayment scheme and their early payments are lipstick on a pig which have no meaningful effect. This was known when the deal was pushed through. I&amp;#39;m fairly certain that as Carvana went up and up and up people forgot some of those top line numbers and those dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bonds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranche 1: 12.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2028&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K. or Cash (CVNA&amp;#39;s discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranche 2: 13.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% or 11% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2030&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K. or 11% Cash (CVNA&amp;#39;s discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranche 3: 14.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2031&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.I.K.February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little translation: P.I.K. is Paid In Kind - basically added to the principle at that interest rate. That provides a fair amount of leeway for Carvana to kick the can down the road, however, that road &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; on August 15th. In October/November&amp;#39;s earnings they&amp;#39;ll be forced to addressed the repayments which exceed their free cash flow. Or not. After that, on February 15th 2026 a whole lotta money is due and there&amp;#39;s no way they can not address it in February&amp;#39;s earnings call. Actually, there&amp;#39;s little value in computing how much is due at those times because it simply cannot be repaid. Free cash flow for the last two quarters was around $600-$700m (total), and debt payments will be close to $220M or more in any 2 quarters - a full third of the (now) positive FCF. Carvana will not be able to buy cars to expand. And the chance of them doubling their free cash flow is slim - even as they eak out a slim profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could only see Tranche 1 August payments they made last earnings as a token &amp;quot;show of force&amp;quot; - $100m prepayment is a drop in the bucket on $5-7B in debt and only trims the expected interest by virtually nothing. It also does explain why the executive team is bailing now - the farther out from these maturities they bail the less likely they could experience clawbacks for engaging in fraud (a&amp;#39;la Sears Roebuck &amp;amp; Co - it&amp;#39;s not fraud if it&amp;#39;s being conducted openly and for a long time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Caravana is split between Hold through Strong Buy, well, another reason not to trust analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One missed earnings and this company is toast. Increased inflation and this company is toast.

,stocks,"Alphabet-owned Waymo announced Monday that it will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Tokyo in early 2025, the company’s first step toward international expansion. 

Waymo hasn’t committed to start commercial service in Tokyo yet, but the robotaxi developer will partner with Japan’s largest taxi operator, Nihon Kotsu, and taxi app GO to start testing its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles in Tokyo’s streets.

To start, Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually operate the Waymo vehicles to map key areas of the Japanese capital, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa, and Kōtō. 

Data from the manned test drives will help train the company’s AI systems. Waymo will also test its robotaxis on a closed course in the U.S. built to mimic driving conditions in Japan.

This is the first phase of the partnerships, which will last several quarters, Waymo told CNBC, adding that it expects to remain in Japan for an extended period.

“Our upcoming road trip to Tokyo gives us the chance to work alongside local partners, government officials, and community groups to understand the new landscape,” Waymo said in a statement. “We’ll learn how Waymo can serve Tokyo’s residents and become a beneficial part of the city’s transportation ecosystem.”

Nihon Kotsu will oversee the management and servicing of Waymo’s vehicles in Japan, the companies said.

Waymo announced a series of expansions across the U.S. in 2024. Earlier this month, the company announced new testing in Miami in 2025, it made its driverless ride hail service available across Los Angeles in November, and in September, it announced planned expansions into Austin and Atlanta in partnership with Uber. 

The move into Japan marks the company’s first in a left-hand traffic market.

Both the Japanese national government and Tokyo Metropolitan government see driverless technology as a potential boon to the country’s aging population, according to research by the World Economic Forum.

Tokyo has designated certain areas as “test zones” for self-driving cars hoping to hasten the arrival of safe driverless transportation systems there.

Several developers are working on autonomous vehicles in Japan, including local startup Tier IV and ZMP, a robotics company that is testing delivery vehicles and buses in Tokyo. Monet Technologies, which is partly owned by Toyota, announced plans to test a self-driving taxi service in Tokyo’s Odaiba district earlier this year.

Waymo’s Japan expansion announcement comes a week after General Motors announced it was abandoning its Cruise robotaxi division. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it aimed to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026 but would re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed.

Prior to GM’s retreat from robotaxis, Cruise had been one of Waymo’s primary domestic competitors.

The Federal Reserve is at a pivotal juncture when it comes to the path of interest rates, while the stock market also faces a critical week amid a period of prolonged broadening weakness.

The central bank is widely expected to cut rates Wednesday—a 97% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. That’s probably a little high, particularly given last week’s sticky inflation data.

In fact, several Fed officials are considering arguing against a cut when officials meet later this week, The Wall Street Journal reported. A hold decision would certainly be a surprise.

A cut is still most likely, but the economic data do not suggest an urgent need to reduce borrowing costs at this point. Consumer prices ticked higher to 2.7% in November, well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The economy is still growing at a decent rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, according to the GDPNow estimate, and the jobs market is showing resilience.

The counterargument is that the fed-funds rate of 4.5% to 4.75% has room to come down a bit further to align with economic conditions.

Even if a quarter-point cut does come gift-wrapped as expected for the market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could still be the Grinch who stole Christmas when he speaks after the decision.

A December cut would be the third in succession. That pace cannot continue, so Powell will need to communicate a coming shift in 2025. It could be the last cut for a while, especially given the inflationary impact of Trump’s potential tariffs.

How Powell conveys the message may be critical for the stock market’s reaction.

The S&amp;P 500 is on an unusual run—more stocks have fallen than risen for 10 consecutive days, the longest such streak since Oct. 2000. The index still hit a record high last week but the majority of stocks are struggling.

,stocks,"**Summary:**

Xinyi Solar Holdings (OTCMKTS: XNYIF), one of the world’s largest solar glass manufacturers, is showing solid growth and profitability, yet trades at a **P/E ratio of 6.5** with a **7.2% dividend yield**. Given its fundamentals, the stock seems undervalued relative to peers, potentially due to macro risks (China FUD, OTC listing). Here’s a balanced breakdown.

**The Business**

Xinyi Solar is a **global leader in solar glass production** – a critical component for all photovoltaic (PV) solar panels.

* **Core Segment**: Solar glass manufacturing, serving panel producers worldwide.
* **Revenue Streams**: Primarily regional (China and Asia), with limited exposure to U.S. tariffs.
* **Scale**: Industry-leading capacity and strong cost controls give them an edge in a competitive market.

  
**Key Financials 📊**

1. **Profit Growth**:
   * H1 2024 profits grew **+41% YoY**, showing resilience despite overcapacity fears.
2. **Dividend Yield**:
   * 7.2% yield, well-covered by cash flow, offering income stability.
3. **Valuation**:
   * P/E Ratio: **6.5**, significantly below global solar peers trading at 15–20x earnings.
4. **Margins**:
   * Operating margins are stable, showing efficient production even with pricing pressure.

**Why It’s Mispriced 🧐**

1. **OTC Stigma**: XNYIF trades OTC in the U.S., limiting visibility and volume.
2. **China Sentiment**: Concerns about Chinese stocks and trade tensions may have spooked investors.
3. **Solar Overcapacity Fears**: The market worries about overproduction, but Xinyi has maintained profitability and margins.

  
**Risks to Consider ⚠️**

* **Geopolitics**: Further U.S. tariffs or trade issues could weigh on sentiment, though Xinyi’s business is regionally focused.
* **Liquidity**: As an OTC stock, trading volume is low, increasing volatility.
* **Market Sentiment**: Negative views on China-related equities can suppress valuation, even if fundamentals are strong.

**The Opportunity**

With solid fundamentals, steady dividends, and an absurdly low valuation, Xinyi Solar could be a mispriced opportunity for value investors. While the risks are real, the financials tell a different story: growth, cash flow, and income stability.

**Questions for the Community:**

1. Do you see undervaluation here, or are the macro risks too significant?
2. How much weight should we place on China-specific fears for regionally focused companies?
3. Are there other solar sector plays that provide similar value with lower risk?

,stocks,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron:

Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year.

Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter.

Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025.

Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications.

In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory.

Currently, 69% of Micron's revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron's revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved.

Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space.

My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months.

In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning.

&lt;p&gt;Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micron&amp;#39;s market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micron&amp;#39;s HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron&amp;#39;s products. NVIDIA&amp;#39;s latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron&amp;#39;s high-performance memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, 69% of Micron&amp;#39;s revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron&amp;#39;s revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron&amp;#39;s future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What&amp;#39;s more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron&amp;#39;s revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron&amp;#39;s share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My target share price: 157&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

,stocks,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.

Aside from being large-cap tech companies, the FAANG stocks were an almost random collection: Apple (a hardware company), Facebook/Meta (social media), Amazon (e-commerce/cloud), Google/Alphabet (search/cloud/ads), and then…Netflix, a pure-play content streamer.

This grouping didn’t make much sense. Netflix doesn’t rely on hardware sales, advertising (to the same extent), or enterprise cloud services. Instead, it’s a company focused on content creation, subscriptions, and global streaming. Being compared directly to companies with vastly different revenue models and margins often painted an incomplete (or unfair) picture for investors.

MDB’s $529.38M (vs estimated $498M) in Q3 is up 22% Y-o-Y. Atlas, their flagship cloud service that works with all hyper-scalers, grew by 26%, accounting for 68% of revenue. EPS was $1.16 (vs estimated 0.67)

**Why MDB fell**

1. Investors were rattled by the CFO/COO's exit, with the company offering little explanation for the departure. However, given that Michael had been with the company since 2015, it seems his exit was well-planned. He sold only 5,000 shares while still holding a significant amount.
2. MongoDB (MDB) has seen an upward trend over the last few months, increasing from $231 in September to $355 by December, prompting some investors to take profits.
3. There was an expectation for a more ambitious forecast for the Atlas platform, which focuses on generating recurring revenue. Nevertheless, the future looks promising for MDB.

**MDB is forecasting stronger Q1 and beyond**

1. The company provided a stronger forecast than expected, projecting $517 million against the anticipated $509 million.
2. Overall, revenue is on an upward trajectory, margins are either stable or improving, cash flow is positive, the balance sheet is getting stronger, and future guidance has been enhanced.
3. The Price to Sales (P/S) ratio has been normalizing: from 20 in Q2'23, down to 16 in Q3'23, and now at 10/11. 
4. The Price to Book (P/B) ratio has also decreased from 34 in Q2'23 to 25 in Q3'23, and currently stands at 14.
5. There's a growing demand for AI applications that require document and distributed models, areas where MongoDB excels. Enterprises are also looking to modernize their legacy applications for analytics, and MongoDB is one of the few platforms capable of aiding in this transition.

Cagrisema:
If they show 25 % weight loss with an okay side effect profile they will have the top of the class drug, which probably will shift momentum in the stock positively. They also just confirmed the full buy of Catalant yesterday. These two things in combination makes a santa rally of 10-20 % possible. Tomorrow we will see an increase of 5-10 % in stock is my guess because of Catalant. And my guess is that the Cagrisema data will be presented during the upcoming week.


They will have many more triggers in the coming time:

Novo Nordisk is expected to present its financial targets for 2025 at the beginning of February, which is important to monitor. 
This should be seen in light of the fact that CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen recently stated during an investor call that, from a mathematical perspective, growth could be expected to land in the “high teens” for the coming year, corresponding to around 17–19%. But the market probably expects a bit more, but if they see much higher growth than that it could significantly move the stock, depending on where revenue growth is anticipated to. Plus the strong dollar would positively influence Novos revenue.

During 2025, Novo Nordisk is expected to present new data – and possibly information about regulatory approval – regarding the oral version of semaglutide, which is essentially Wegovy in pill form.
The oral version of semaglutide demonstrated a 17% weight loss in a 68-week study, matching the results of the Wegovy injection.

In addition to weight-loss medications in pill form, attention may also turn to semaglutide’s effects on Alzheimer’s disease and much more.

Novo has always guided quite conservatively and they are the ones themselves who has communicated that they expect around 25 % weight loss on Cagrisema, so it would surprise me if the data is worse than that. If 23 % expect 10-15 % drawdown in the stock shortterm.

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

&lt;p&gt;Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I&amp;#39;d appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"I’ve been looking into Evolution AB lately, and wanted to share some thoughts. The stock has dropped about 20% over the last six months, which has raised some questions. The latest report showed a 5% increase in revenues, but the profits were a bit weaker than expected. A big part of the dip seems to stem from concerns about slower growth – competition is rising, and stricter regulations could impact things in the short term.

For those who aren't familiar, Evolution AB is a leading company in the online gambling space, specializing in live casino solutions. They operate platforms like Evolution Gaming and NetEnt, offering live dealer games to online casinos. They’ve been incredibly successful in dominating the live casino market, with a strong presence in Europe and significant expansion in North America and Asia.

Looking ahead, I still think the company has a solid long-term outlook. Despite short-term challenges, Evolution continues to innovate, and its market leadership in live casino gaming remains strong. They’re also tapping into emerging markets, which could fuel growth moving forward.

So, should you buy now? If you're a long-term investor and can handle some short-term volatility, this could be a good opportunity to buy the dip. But if you’re looking for quick returns, it might be better to wait and see if the stock drops even further.

,stocks,"As a longtime Broadcom investor, I am very pleased with its fourth quarter and full year FY2024 results.

QUARTERLY REVENUE: Broadcom achieved record revenues of $14.05 billion, up 51% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.

Artificial Intelligence Revenue: full year revenue reached $12.2 billion, up 220% year-over-year, far outperforming market expectations.

Free cash flow: reached $5.5 billion, or 39% of revenue, demonstrating strong profitability.

Gross margin: maintained at a high level of 77%, further demonstrating its efficient operating model and strong market position.

VMware Acquisitions and Growth Potential

The integration of VMware has been significant and has had an immediate and profound impact on Broadcom is profitability:

Software revenues: nearly doubled from $2.8 billion to $5.8 billion since the acquisition.

High Gross Margins: Gross margins in the software business are as high as 90%, which provides the company with ample cash flow and sets the stage for future expansion and return to shareholders.

From my perspective, VMware is integration not only improves operational efficiency, but also provides solid support for further growth in FY2025.

Leadership in AI infrastructure

Broadcom is performance in AI gives me confidence in its future:

Core products: Broadcom is custom AI gas pedals, Ethernet switches and optical transceivers continue to lead the market, meeting strong demand in the data center and cloud computing markets.

Revenue drivers: High growth in AI-related businesses further solidifies Broadcom is leadership in AI infrastructure.

Broadcom is outlook for Q1 2025 makes me even more optimistic about its future:

Revenue forecast: expected to reach $14.6 billion, up 22% YoY and 4% sequentially.

EBITDA forecast: expected to be $9.64 billion, with continued industry-leading margins.

Shareholder returns: Dividend increased 11% to $0.59 per share and payout ratio lowered to 0.50, demonstrating free cash flow growth potential.

Customer Diversification: Despite Apple's plans to reduce its reliance on Broadcom's Wi-Fi + Bluetooth chips, I'm confident that Broadcom is new AI gas pedal partnership agreement with Apple will more than offset the potential impact.

Risk diversification: Broadcom is business spans multiple sectors, including AI, software, wireless and networking, greatly reducing the risk of dependence on a single customer.

As a long-time tech stock investor, I think Broadcom is impressive performance in AI, data centers, and software, combined with efficient management and strategic acquisitions, make its long-term growth prospects very solid.

Its excellent margins and strong cash flow performance reduce investment risk, and I think Broadcom offers a good risk-reward ratio.

From my perspective, Broadcom is a quality stock to buy and hold for the long term.

Broadcom has demonstrated strong profitability and potential for continued growth with its leadership position in artificial intelligence and software, as well as synergies from the VMware integration. Although there is some uncertainty in the external market environment, Broadcom is diversified business structure and efficient operational management give me confidence in its future.

As a leader in AI-driven data solutions, Palantir has demonstrated remarkable performance recently, with a 308.95% increase over the past year and a 20.40% rise in the past month. If you are looking for momentum and short-term returns, Palantir might be the ideal choice, riding the wave of its optimistic outlook

Particularly after the launch of AIP, which integrates generative AI and data analysis, the scope of market applications has significantly expanded. Long-term contracts in the defense sector appear to provide a stable source of cash flow. The financial reports indicate a turnaround to profitability, marking an important milestone for a data analytics company. Emerging markets such as supply chain and healthcare also present potential growth opportunities

A positive signal lies in its continued momentum. Recently, the company has collaborated with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Shield AI, further strengthening its position in defense technology. These developments enhance its profitability and market competitiveness

For those following the news, the market dips on Monday and Tuesday were mainly due to institutions and funds avoiding risks ahead of the CPI data release. Yesterday, the CPI met expectations, suggesting a strong likelihood of U.S interest rate cuts—a positive signal for the market. Being added to the Nasdaq-100 would undoubtedly provide the best incentive for further growth

Long-term government contracts and defense projects offer stability, which is crucial for withstanding the volatility of the tech sector. Palantir’s shift to profitability marks a significant milestone, demonstrating its maturing business model and growing earnings potential

With strong technical capabilities in AI and big data analytics, I am highly confident in Palantir’s future. In the medium and long term, Palantir is likely to benefit from its technological innovation and the expansion of the AI market. As an investor, I find Palantir’s performance this year to be surprising and impressive

Its long-term partnerships with the government and the attainment of FedRAMP High authorization further prove the security and compliance of its cloud services. Palantir has significantly exceeded market expectations, with rapid growth in demand for its AI-related products driving profitability

If you analyze this stock closely, you’ll notice that for the past two months, it has shown consistent growth every Friday

,stocks,"Costco on Thursday beat Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and sales estimates, as it got a boost in part from higher membership fees.

Here’s how the warehouse club did for the fiscal first quarter compared to what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: $4.04 vs. $3.79 expected
* Revenue: $62.15 billion vs. $62.08 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Nov. 24, Costco’s net income rose to $1.80 billion, or 4.04 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.58 per share in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $57.80 billion in the year-ago period.

Costco has benefitted from its reputation for selling bulk items at better value, as U.S. households feel the cumulative effect of higher food and housing prices. The membership-based club also hiked its annual membership fee for the first time in about seven years. The quarterly results are the first Costco has reported since that fee increase took effect in September.

Costco’s membership fees came in at $1.17 billion, compared to the $1.16 billion Wall Street had expected.

As of Thursday’s close, share of Costco are up nearly 50% so far this year, surpassing the 27% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same time period. Shares closed at $988.39 on Thursday.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

,stocks,"Adobe shares fell 14% on Thursday, their steepest drop since September 2022, after the software vendor issued disappointing revenue guidance.

Sales in the fiscal first quarter will be between $5.63 billion and $5.68 billion, Adobe said in its fourth-quarter earnings report late Wednesday. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.73 billion, according to LSEG.

Analysts at TD Cowen downgraded the stock to hold from buy, while Wells Fargo kept its buy rating following what it called a “frustrating ’24” for the company. The stock is now down 20% for the year, badly trailing the Nasdaq, which is up 33% and crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday.

While Adobe’s forecast trailed estimates, the company’s fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.81, topping the average analyst estimate of $4.66, according to LSEG. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $5.61 billion, beating the average estimate of $5.54 billion.

Monetizing generative artificial intelligence, especially in stand-alone offerings such as Firefly image generation or additional offerings across the Creative Cloud, has been central to Adobe’s growth strategy.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank maintained their buy rating but lowered their target price from $650 to $600.

“These results and guidance require a bit of faith in the full year next year,” the analysts wrote. Still, they said, “We see tangible evidence that Adobe is one of few application software companies in our coverage successfully monetizing generative AI today.”

&gt; Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.

&gt; His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

&gt; Musk’s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg’s calculation still seems to include the pay package, which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares.",t2_4e0be210,False,,0,False,Elon Musk becomes the first person to reach a net worth of $400 billion,[],r/stocks,False,6,offtopic,0,,False,t3_1hca86o,False,,0.82,,public,6245,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Off-Topic,False,6245,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1733968280.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/business/elon-musk-400-billion-net-worth/index.html""&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/business/elon-musk-400-billion-net-worth/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s net worth has reached $400 billion, according to Bloomberg, making him the first person ever to cross that mark. Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

,stocks,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a core driver of the modern economy, and I am increasingly seeing its far-reaching impact across a wide range of industries. As someone who cares about investment opportunities, I see great potential in investing in AI-related companies, especially those that are leaders in technology, business model and market share. Of the many choices, there are two companies in particular that I favor and believe can help investors grow their wealth: Nvidia and Palantir Technologies

Nvidia is the leader in AI hardware and has been a mainstay in high-performance computing and deep learning. I've been impressed with the technical strength of its GPUs, which are used in a wide range of applications such as data centers, cloud computing, autonomous driving, and generative AI. As the demand for computing power for generative AI applications like ChatGPT explodes, I'm confident that demand for Nvidia's products will soar even further

In 2023, Nvidia's data center business saw record revenues and demonstrated technology leadership with its new H100 GPUs and Grace Hopper superchips. Combined with partnerships with cloud giants like AWS and Azure, I think Nvidia's market share will continue to grow. Analysts predict the generative AI market will reach nearly $100 billion over the next five years, and Nvidia will undoubtedly be a big part of that wave. I believe that holding the company's stock for the long term is expected to provide significant returns

Palantir's focus on data analytics and AI solutions gives me confidence in its market potential. The company offers the Gotham and Foundry platforms for government and enterprise, respectively, to help users extract value from large-scale data. I am particularly interested in Palantir's newly launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which combines generative AI technology to provide users with real-time data insights and decision support

On the financial front, Palantir has become profitable in 2023, which is an important turning point for a company. The company has also successfully expanded into emerging markets such as healthcare and energy, and has signed a long-term contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, further strengthening its revenue stream. I see more growth opportunities for Palantir in the future as the demand for data-driven decision-making in the enterprise grows

While both companies look promising, I also recognize that the AI industry is rapidly changing and that innovations from competitors can pose challenges. In addition, government regulation of AI could increase uncertainty, and the high valuations of these companies could lead to high volatility in their stock prices

For me, Nvidia and Palantir represent different opportunities for hardware and software in AI, with Nvidia dominating the infrastructure space with its hardware strengths and Palantir meeting the needs of enterprises and governments with its data analytics capabilities.

I am aware that folks at JP, Goldman, etc. with quant degrees know a lot more than I do. I'm just a lowly accountant. But we ain't talking active trading strategy here. This is about doing a little better than passive index, buy-n-hold. Well, that's why we login to Reddit, afterall.

**Context-2:** We've had 26% and 28% gains in S&amp;P in last two years. So, 2025 is likely to be a 'modest' year or a bad year.

Portfolio A: 100% in S&amp;P, e.g. $10,000

Portfolio B: 90% in cash (money market fund), 10% used to buy Dec-2025 call option, 10% OTM.

Portfolio C: 90% in cash (money market fund), 5% used to buy Jun-2025 call option, 5% OTM, repeated again mid-year, with Dec 2025 option.

^(Note: I've checked option prices, so the projected profits are reasonable correct. Cash return assumed at 4% ($360 on $9000).)

||Bullish scenario S&amp;P +10%|Boring year scenario, V shaped recovery|Bearish scenario, S&amp;P -10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A: 100% of $10,000 in S&amp;P|$1000 gain|$0 (took on market risk, suffered volatility). |\- $1000 |
|B: Cash + Option|$360 gain on cash + $2000 gain on the option. That Dec-2025 option expected to become 3X in bull market. This is a resonable assumption. Just see the option chain. |$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|
|C: Cash + multiple bullish option trades|$360 gain on cash + $3000 gain on the options. 4X jump on two options bought with $500. Note that these are only 5% OTM options, so this guy got lucky twice. Because, the distance to strike is less, gains are bigger. |$360 gain on cash + $1500 gain on only one option. 4X jump on one of the two options bought with $500.|Minus $640 - as above. |



**Conclusion**: Leaving 90% in cash/ money markets, and just buying affordable OTM Calls with far-out expiry, is more profitable and less volatile than the Booglehead way. This isn't a surprise, because effectively, you leverage (i.e. borrow) to play the market risk, without taking on full downside risk. This costs you, in terms of premium, and doesn't pay off in a boring, flat market (middle column in table above).

**Remark 1:** This 'strategy' is inspired from Nancy Pelosi. She is fond of buying December 2027 Calls in millions. Perhaps, her calls suffer temporary dips in short term, but when the thing plays out, she has 10X-ed her capital.

**Remark 2:** Aware that emergency funds should be separate from invested portfolio, but this $9000 cash could give the user a bit more peace of mind, because it stays as cash for full year, ready at fingertips, irrespective of the market conditions.

The company has an enormous dividend yield, so if that is something you value, maybe it's worth a look for that alone.

But the reason I am posting is this: due to a special dividend, the stock price has taken a substantial blow. It seems to have consolidated itself though, with a relatively stable worth of around 9,44$. 

Is this an opportune moment to invest in a company that expects some lucrative years, due to an already undertaken modernization scheme that has been paid off already?

,stocks,"Tesla shares jumped to an all-time high on Wednesday, surpassing their prior record reached in 2021, sparked by a post-election rally and Wall Street’s increased enthusiasm for Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company.

The stock rose to an intraday high of $415, which is 50 cents above its previous peak, and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish, which was $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021.

Tesla’s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump’s election victory early last month. The stock’s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.

Musk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.

The world’s richest person, who’s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies’ budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level.

“The stock is responding to the Trump bump,” Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that “Musk’s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla’s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.”

On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that “the market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.”

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.

Since Trump’s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.

Tesla’s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company’s shares plunged 29% in the first three months of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla’s core business, which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.

In its third-quarter earnings report in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” That forecast was ahead of analysts’ predictions.

,stocks,"Apple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.

Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple’s AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Wednesday updates also include Apple’s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.

&lt;li&gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in November, after rising 0.2 percent in each of the previous 4 months, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 2.7 percent before seasonal adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The index for shelter rose 0.3 percent in November, accounting for nearly forty percent of the monthly all items increase. The food index also increased over the month, rising 0.4 percent as the food at home index increased 0.5 percent and the food away from home index rose 0.3 percent. The energy index rose 0.2 percent over the month, after being unchanged in October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in November, as it did in each of the previous 3 months. Indexes that increased in November include shelter, used cars and trucks, household furnishings and operations, medical care, new vehicles, and recreation. The index for communication was among the few major indexes that decreased over the month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The all items index rose 2.7 percent for the 12 months ending November, after rising 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending October. The all items less food and energy index rose 3.3 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index decreased 3.2 percent for the 12 months ending November. The food index increased 2.4 percent over the last year.&lt;/li&gt;

,stocks,"I’ve been closely monitoring UnitedHealth Group (UNH) recently, and I noticed it’s been under significant pressure, with the stock now hovering around $518, down nearly 3% today. Last week’s news regarding the tragic incident with the CEO definitely shook things up, but I’m wondering: is this selloff more of an emotional reaction than a reflection of the company’s fundamentals?

Here’s my breakdown of the situation and why I think this could be an opportunity for long-term investors:

- Trailing P/E is on the high side at 34.69, but the forward P/E is 17.89, much more reasonable and closer to sector averages.

- The PEG ratio is 1.47, which suggests a fair valuation given its growth prospects.

- Revenue grew +9.2% YoY in the most recent quarter, with net income up +3.66%.

- Dividend growth has been consistently strong, averaging over 20% annual increases since 2010. Current dividend yield sits at 1.6%, with room for future hikes given a payout ratio of ~52%.

- The stock tested support around $515 today and saw a slight bounce.

- VWAP is $526, so the stock is trading below its average price, indicating near-term bearish sentiment, but it could also mean a potential opportunity for buyers.

UNH remains the leader in the healthcare sector, a defensive industry with favorable long-term trends like an aging population and rising demand for healthcare services.
Analysts have a target price range of $580-$600, suggesting a potential upside of 10-15% from current levels.

Do you think this drop is more of an overreaction tied to recent news rather than a reflection of any real weakness in UNH’s business fundamentals? Could the stock test lower levels (e.g., $500), or is the $515 support a solid floor for a potential recovery?

So, what happens when a publicly traded company decides to go private at a buyout share price that is below my average buying price of the stock ( being a minority share holder)

1. Say for example, I bought 100 shares of one company @ 100 USD each, however now, it decides to go private through a share buyout @ 90 USD / share. Will I be forced out of my position at a realised loss? Also, what if the price / share climbs up to 120 / share at the time of privatisation? Would I get realised @ buyout price of 90 / share or trading price of 120/ share?

2. Now, just by the news release, the company currently trades @ 110 USD / share.

,stocks,"This year, stocks of the “Big 7,” including Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, have soared, including a nearly 3% gain on Wednesday. Tech ETFs have hit 29 new highs this year.



Oracle: strong growth, attractive valuation



Oracle shares fell 6% to $178 after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Monday. Nonetheless, its shares have doubled since the end of 2022. This share price decline is a natural market reaction to high expectations.



The earnings report showed good prospects for Oracle future growth. Quarterly revenue rose 8.6% year-on-year to $14.1 billion, with cloud revenue up 24% to $5.9 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue reaching a further $2.4 billion. Oracle is migrating customers from traditional data storage to its efficient AI-enabled services. Future third-quarter revenue is expected to grow 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate growth of up to 10%



Oracle cloud infrastructure business is growing faster than the industry average, and overall annual revenue growth is expected to remain above 10% going forward. Although AI-related investments will put pressure on margins in the short term, analysts expect its average annual earnings per share growth rate to reach 18% over the next four years. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times expected earnings over the next 12 months is significantly lower than the average for the U.S. software industry, but its growth outlook is much stronger and the stock has room for further upside



Teradyne: Robotics and Chip Testing



Shares of Teradyne, a $19 billion robotics and chip-testing equipment maker, are down about 27% from their summer high of $163.21, and currently stand at $120. A recent slowdown in capital spending by industrial customers has led to a deceleration in growth in its industrial business, but the long-term outlook remains positive



Sales in this segment are expected to recover as industrial customers resume investment in automation equipment. Meanwhile, growing demand for AI chips is driving increased demand for chip test equipment. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 5% to $737 million. The analysis predicts that the market in which Teradyne is located could reach $19 billion by the end of the century, with its industry position strong and only Tokyo-based Advantest as its main competitor



Analysts expect Teradyne revenue and earnings per share to grow to $4.1 billion and $5.99, respectively, by 2026. If the company proves to be on a good trajectory, shares are expected to rally. Its price-to-earnings ratio is currently 28 times, down from a yearly high of 37 times



AMD: The AI chip chaser



AMD shares fell 39% to $127 from a high of $227.30 in March as AI chip sales missed expectations. However, the company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance to $5 billion from $4.5 billion



AMD CEO Zifeng Su said the long-term size of the AI chip market could exceed $500 billion. NVIDIA currently occupies a $100 billion market, but customers still need to diversify their supply chains, and AMD is the second-biggest option after NVIDIA



Analysts expect AMD annual sales of data center chips, including AI chips, to grow 36% to $31 billion by 2027. A lower price-to-earnings ratio (26x vs. Nvidia 33x) also provides upside to its stock price



These three companies are uniquely positioned for long-term growth potential in the AI wave, and may be worth considering as a “second tier” for investors who missed Nvidia surge

I’m doing some research into Commvault’s stock and over the past few years, its performance has been great. I have been in the Backup &amp; Recovery software industry for quite some time and in doing public research, it appears they are losing customers hand over fist. Additionally, their software is incredibly complex but strive where others cannot backup bare metal workloads. I will say, the one good thing going for them is ability to protect AHV and Hyper-V hypervisors, but so can Rubrik and Cohesity, which are much more superior products - especially Rubrik. Commvault is like a better version of EMC’s Networker, which is incredibly legacy. Most people love Commvault for the good quality support (which makes the worlds different in the DPS industry). They announced they are moving Tier 1 support overseas and no longer using U.S employees. That will have major implications on successful future renewals. They purchased Clumio, which does AWS native backups (mainly for M365, which most companies don’t seem to care about - not talking about Fortune 500 companies or Healthcare organizations). Even with Clumio, isn’t Druva a much better platform for this? Rubrik just announced earnings and beat expectations by 48%, mainly attributed to new customers (many of which came from CVLT). 

I am struggling to understand why the street is so bullish on the stock. Wouldn’t this be a clear short? I cannot wrap my head around the fact that CVLT’s short interest is only 2% (12/11/24).

&gt; President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission. He will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars’ worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior. Ferguson is already one of the FTC’s five commissioners, which is currently made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. “Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, “Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.”

&gt; The replacement of Khan likely means that the FTC will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions. “These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,” wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland &amp; Knight, in a recent analysis.

&gt; Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country’s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night. Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC’s efforts to block the deal, some experts have said. And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior.

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

,stocks,"Perpetua Resources (PPTA) is at a critical juncture in its development of the Stibnite Gold Project, which has the potential to become one of the U.S.'s only domestic sources of antimony. This is a timely opportunity, especially in light of China's recent ban on antimony exports, which is heightening the strategic importance of U.S. production. With the **Record of Decision (ROD)** expected any day now, PPTA’s stock could see significant movement depending on how the situation unfolds.

**The Importance of Antimony and the Global Market Shift**

Antimony is a critical mineral used in everything from flame retardants, space technology, and batteries, and the U.S. has been largely dependent on imports to meet its needs. Until recently, China has been the dominant supplier of antimony. However, as of November 2024, China has imposed restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, including antimony. This development has prompted both the U.S. government and private industry to shift focus toward securing domestic supplies of antimony, and Perpetua Resources stands in a favorable position to meet this demand.

This situation increases the urgency for the **Stibnite Gold Project** in Idaho, as it could become a key source of both antimony and gold. As the U.S. government seeks to diversify its critical mineral supply chains, Perpetua’s potential to fill this gap has garnered increased attention from investors and policymakers alike.

**The Role of Antimony in Spacecraft Technology**

Antimony plays a key role in space technology due to its unique properties, such as flame resistance, high thermal stability, and its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of electronic systems. In spacecraft, antimony is commonly used in **soldering alloys** for electronics, **batteries**, and **semiconductors** that are essential for power management and communication systems. Additionally, its flame-retardant qualities make it useful in materials designed for **thermal protection** and **heat shields**. Notable space companies like **NASA**, **SpaceX**, **Lockheed Martin**, and **Boeing** are likely to use antimony-based compounds in various spacecraft components. For example, SpaceX's **Dragon spacecraft** and **Starship** incorporate antimony in their **electronics** and **batteries**, while Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and MDA Space with their work on **satellites** and **space exploration missions**, rely on antimony-enhanced alloys for structural and electronic components. These materials are essential in ensuring the durability and reliability of spacecraft as they endure the extreme conditions of space.

**What’s Happening with the ROD?**

The **Record of Decision (ROD)** is the final approval needed from the U.S. Forest Service for the Stibnite Gold Project to proceed with its development. The ROD marks the end of a lengthy environmental review process and the beginning of the company’s construction and operational phases. This decision is expected to come soon, end of year—meaning we are very close to a major turning point for Perpetua Resources:

**The 45-Day Time Window**

The ROD is required to be issued within **45 days** of the U.S. Forest Service’s publication of the **Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)**. The FEIS was published in October 26^(th) 2024, putting the deadline for the ROD around  **5 December 2024**. This time frame is critical, as it sets the stage for the next steps in the project’s development. Investors are watching closely, knowing that the issuance of the ROD could lead to a surge in stock price, as it would signify a major regulatory victory for the company.

**What Does This Mean for Investors?**

The upcoming **ROD** could have major implications for Perpetua Resources' stock. If the decision is favorable (and considering china's ban on antimony, this is practically a given, together with the emerging space race), the company will have the green light to move ahead with construction, which could lead to long-term value creation. Investors may see this as a bullish signal, potentially driving the stock price higher in anticipation of future production.

Given the critical role that antimony plays in the U.S. economy and the political backing of domestic projects, Perpetua Resources is positioned to benefit from both its strategic project and increasing governmental focus on critical minerals. The involvement of John Paulson, with his close ties to Trump, may further support the company’s efforts to fast-track approvals and secure necessary financing. As the company moves closer to breaking ground, these factors could all converge to drive significant value for investors looking to capitalize on the growing demand for U.S.-sourced antimony.

,stocks,"Oracle shares dropped 8% on Tuesday and headed for their steepest decline in a year following the database software vendor’s disappointing earnings report.

The stock’s worst day of the year had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 68% in 2024, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999.

After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate.

Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue.

“A bit of a stumble here for a stock that’s created some lofty expectations for itself,” wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said “we still like oracle heading into 2025.”

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57.

Oracle’s biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers.  
  
The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.  
  
Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models.

“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world’s most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,” Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement.

Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 “based on continued cloud momentum.” They cited Oracle’s cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen &amp; Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse.

&gt;By building data centers next to purpose-built, carbon-free energy sources, Google aims to ease power grid constraints and reduce delivery timelines for both power generation and data center projects.

&gt;Google will be a main customer for the clean energy produced by Intersect Power's new facilities and will open new data centers that use this clean energy right away, the company said.

,stocks,"I keep seeing a lot of discourse surrounding the developments about the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon. There is political risk given that Trump and Biden both have made public statements saying they oppose the deal going through, and would work to prevent it.

,stocks,"Shares of Walgreens jumped about 20% on Tuesday on a report that the company is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. 

Walgreens and Sycamore have been discussing a deal that could be completed early next year, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. New York-based Sycamore would likely sell off pieces of Walgreens’ business or work with partners, the Journal reported.

A Walgreens spokesperson declined to comment on the reported talks.

The report comes during a rough period for the retail pharmacy giant. The company’s stock was down more than 60% for the year before its climb Tuesday.

Walgreens — squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, a leadership shakeup, pharmacy reimbursement headwinds and its wobbly push into health care — has underperformed Wall Street’s earnings expectations for two straight quarters. Walgreens’ pharmacy business in particular has been flailing due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and several factors pressuring the front of the store, such as inflation and increased competition.

The company is trying to regain its footing with a new CEO, health-care industry veteran Tim Wentworth. Since stepping into the role in October 2023, Wentworth has moved to slash costs at Walgreens.

In October, Walgreens said it plans to close roughly 1,200 of its drugstores over the next three years, including 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. Walgreens has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable. The company has also scaled back its push into primary care by cutting its stake in primary care provider VillageMD. 

Walgreens has reportedly been seen as a potential private equity target in the past. 

In 2019, private equity firm KKR made a roughly $70 billion buyout offer to the company, the Financial Times and Bloomberg reported at the time.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

,stocks,"Alright unless you been living under a rock you heard or seen some videos of self driving vehicles be it waymo or tesla. The future of self driving vehicles is not a question of if at this point but when .
My question to you is this - how do you see uber play out in this changing fat environment. In your view do you see uber benefiting or losing from the rise of AV brought in by smaller and bigger companies.

Here is my take and I’m also not fully clear (I think the CEO needs to come out and clarify clearly their path and their different partnership goals).

Uber clearly wants to be a software company, the biggest aggregator of all mobility needs. They spent like crazy to be number 1 in travel. They spent like crazy during Covid to be the number 1 food delivery service. They spending like crazy on grocery delivery from what I notice and they eye to grow their freight business.

All their investments and actions points towards the aggregator strategy , from offloading their own self driving decision to Aurora to investing in all kinds of different startup from Serv robotics to Aurora (25% ownership) and companies in India, Asia and Latin America.

Can this strategy back fire? It could, however let’s ask , what does Google want? Google up until this point was mainly a software company, yes they produce their own pixel phones but I believe their main competitor is not Uber but Tesla. Google might be expanding their taxi service but is the end goal for them to be a global taxi company? I think not. There is much more profit in expanding the waymo service up until they prove that their software reached maturity. At that point Google will lease that software to any car manufacturer for a price, growing revenue in speeds that they won’t be able to match staying exclusive, hence the Tesla competitor. In the scenario that they lease/sell their software to any car manufacturer, it won’t be the end of the road for Uber because at worst case they can purchase a fleet of cars to continue their operations and supplement their other AV partners.

Now let’s assume waymo stays exclusive and Google interested to be a taxi company, meaning their partnership with Uber will end and they essentially going to compete with Uber. In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).

This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.

In this case, uber investments in Aurora Innovation might come helpful, they can re-acquire Aurora and their tech for whatever it’s worth and build on top of it. They can use their large cash flow to acquire a smaller AV company that struggles to compete with the big players and build on it. In both scenarios uber has a way out, as long as they don’t lay on their stomach blinded by short term profits (think BlackBerry in early 2000) and make sure to pivot at the right moment (if aggregator role dont workout, time to go shopping for small AV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I see it, I will be happy for anyone to challenge this view because sometime we all get blinded by our own biases.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Nvidia shares were under pressure Monday after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the chipmaker over possible violations to the country’s antimonopoly law.

Shares slipped about 2% before the bell.

The State Administration for Market Regulation opened an investigation into the chipmaker in relation to acquisition of Mellanox, the Chinese government said Monday.

“In recent days, due to Nvidia’s suspected violation of China’s anti-monopoly law and the State Administration for Market Regulation’s restrictive conditions around Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox shares ... the State Administration for Market Regulation is opening a probe into Nvidia in accordance with law,” according to a statement translated by CNBC.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as competition heats up between the U.S. and China over chipmaking capabilities, with the Biden administration last week announcing a final slew of curbs targeting semiconductor toolmakers.

The U.S. has amped up restrictions on chip sales to the second-largest economy in recent years, barring Nvidia and other key semiconductors from selling their most advanced AI chips in an effort to limit the country from strengthening its military. The company has worked to create new products to sell in China that abide by the U.S. regulations.

Shares of the AI chip darling have outperformed this year, rallying nearly 188% as investors ramp up bets on the sector more than two years after ChatGPT’s initial debut. Shares have also helped push the market the market to new highs, along with the broader technology sector.

,stocks,"I know after recent CEO firings, sentiment is low right now. But usually the best bargains are when investors are fearful. Not financial advice.

Intel has been one of the worst performing stocks in the last several years. They just got rid of a CEO, their foundries have not been up to the task, they are severely behind Nvidia and AMD in AI sector with GPUs, they have reported poor earnings, and their consumer CPUs and wafers have been getting railroaded by AMD and TSMC. 

However, I believe now is the best time to invest. 

I believe things are finally starting to turn ship for Intel. For example - 

* Their 18As have been getting decent yields despite the biased reporting, and look promising. Sure, TSMC is still their biggest rival and ahead of Intel, but Intel can catch up. If they can pluck a few talents from TSMC, or invest greater in their R&amp;D, with US govt chip money backing them, it's possible.
* US government has a vested interest is not letting Intel to fail - it's a geopolitical issue to have cutting edge processor technology in US. If US continues to pump money into Intel just like Taiwan has done for TSMC, Intel can afford to expand its foundries and research cutting edge tech.
* Intel's new Battlemage GPUs seem really cost efficient and there is strong positive sentiment. They will start to gobble up more marketshare and absorb more of Nvidia's AI market as Intel's technology grows in the next gen. This is huge. Nvidia's marketcap is so big that if Intel even eats a bit of the AI market, it will grow exponentially. 
   * Intel's GPU technology looks already promising seeing how they are catching up in drivers and software, and their XeSS technology is ALREADY better than AMD's FSR. 
* They have been getting leaner with mass layoffs and shutting down European plants, and recently reported sell-to-lease transactions. They are cutting costs where they can. 
* Their recent mobile chips - Lunar Lake, have performed fantastic, with high performance and low wattage (which is critical for laptops that suffer under high heat). 

Additionally, if China invades Taiwan, Intel instantly will skyrocket overnight.

&lt;p&gt;Intel has been one of the worst performing stocks in the last several years.

,stocks,"“Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.

“My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,” Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.

Bezos’s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

One of the cornerstone projects under Bezos’s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon’s AI capabilities.

Although Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon’s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.

“I’ll always be there to help, and right now, I’m putting a lot of time into it,” Bezos said. “It’s super interesting, so why not?”

Amazon’s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.

Bezos’s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon’s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company’s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.

Bezos’s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon’s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos’s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.”

Together, the companies will expand their capacity to create comprehensive full-funnel solutions that deliver better outcomes for the world’s most sophisticated clients.

&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Interpublic shareholders will receive 0.344 Omnicom shares for each share of Interpublic common stock they own.

The transaction is expected to generate annual cost synergies of $750 million.

Here’s my back of the envelope math that I’m hoping y’all can help fill out a little more. This is just a primer to get the convo flowing. Please keep it civil, factual, and support assertions with numbers/facts. Please. 

In 2015 staples tried to purchased Office Depot for $6.3b, but the deal was killed by the FTC. They tried again in 2021 offering $2.1b. This got me wondering, why? Where’s the value? Well, there may be a little. 

ODP is comprised of Four business units: 1) ODP Business Solutions, LLC (B2B); 2) Office Depot, LLC (retail); 3) Veyer, LLC (logistics); and 4) Varis, Inc. (digital procurement). 

 The latter 2 are interesting and showed  decent growth: Veyer (25%) and Varis (14%). ODP “sold” most of Varis but still owns about 20%. They actually paid the buyer to take it off their hands (this plays a small role in my broader thesis of why ODP NEEDS to sell, the leadership is totally incompetent). 

The company is shrinking, and rapidly. But they have $181mm in cash. Net income of $139mm. Receivables are $487mm. Inventory $765mm. They own real estate that’s worth about $86mm (but hard to confirm). $1.04B in debt. Total liabilities of 2.785B. Current market cap is $779mm. 

Removing debt from the equation, conservatively I put the value around $1.1b. That’s a 41% delta/upside. 

But, factoring in debt, it’s a different picture (obviously). They’ve manage to decrease their interest expense every year, going from $89mm in 2019 to $20mm in 2023. They recently restructured their revolver and the new maturity date is 2029, so they have time. There’s also a $250mm accordion allowing them to increase the loan from $800mm to $1.05b. 

The logistics component (veyer) seems interesting and promising but it sounds like they’re unhappy with the performance there as well — again just really poor management.

Here's how it played out.

**The Strategies**

1. **Yearly Lump Sum**: Investing $10,000 at the beginning of each year.
2. **Monthly Investment**: Breaking $10,000 into 12 equal parts ($833.33) and investing at the start of each month.
3. **Daily Investment**: Spreading $10,000 evenly across all trading days in a year.

**Overall Results (End of 2024)**

* **Yearly Lump Sum**: $53,461, with an overall cumulative return of **\~434.6%**.
* **Monthly Investment**: $51,435, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.4%**.
* **Daily Investment**: $51,446, with an overall cumulative return of **\~414.5%**.

After conducting a 20-year test comparing three popular investment strategies—lump-sum investing, monthly contributions, and daily contributions—I found that the yearly lump-sum strategy provided the highest overall returns. At first glance, this might seem like a definitive answer to the perennial question of how to invest for the best outcome. But the more I analyzed the results, the more I began to question whether the data truly tells the whole story.

EDIT:

my resaerch was completely wrong and goes to show that AI is only as good as the data that you put into it. These are the final results after some tweaks:  
  
**Yearly Lump Sum**: $163,573.96

**Monthly Investment:** $180,559.47

**Weekly Investment:** $182,003.40

**Daily Investment:** $131,120.43

Clover Health Investments (CLOV) is a health tech company that focuses on Medicare Advantage plans, using its proprietary technology platform, Clover Assistant, to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Its business model emphasizes equity in healthcare, chronic disease management, and early disease identification to enhance outcomes and control expenses.

Why CLOV is Gaining Attention:
	1.	Improved Financial Performance:
	•	In Q3 2024, CLOV reported a significant improvement in financial metrics:
	•	Adjusted EBITDA increased to $19.3M, up from $2.7M year-over-year.
	•	Insurance revenue rose 7% to $322.6M 
	•	The company raised its full-year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $55-65M, signaling confidence in profitability and growth 
	2.	Technical Indicators:
	•	Recent trading patterns suggest a potential reversal from a downtrend. Articles mention a “hammer chart pattern,” which indicates that selling pressure (from “bears”) may be weakening, potentially giving way to buying momentum (from “bulls”) 
	3.	Strategic Advancements:
	•	CLOV achieved a 4.0-star rating for its flagship PPO plan, improving competitiveness and allowing for higher reimbursement rates from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 

Competitors and Similar Companies:

CLOV competes with other Medicare Advantage providers and health-tech-driven insurance companies like Humana (HUM), Alignment Healthcare (ALHC), and Oscar Health (OSCR).
	•	Humana, a larger player, has shown steady growth but operates at a different scale.
	•	Smaller competitors like Alignment Healthcare have also faced challenges similar to CLOV in maintaining profitability, with mixed stock performance in 2024.

Current Stock Performance:

CLOV has experienced significant volatility in 2024, with bears dominating earlier in the year. However, improved earnings, technical indicators, and bullish sentiment have made it a candidate for speculative recovery. It is still priced below many competitors, appealing to value-oriented investors

Conclusion:

Clover Health’s focus on leveraging technology for healthcare innovation and its financial turnaround make it a speculative buy for those willing to bet on its continued recovery and market positioning. However, its risks include cash flow concerns and competitive pressure.

Benjamin Graham once said, “Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.” This quote inspired me to design an investment strategy that mirrors the due diligence and rigor of buying a private business. Instead of relying on trends or speculation, I sought to focus on key factors that truly drive long-term value. These include growth per share, creditworthiness, return on invested capital (ROIC), and shareholder payout. By integrating these metrics into a systematic framework, I aimed to build a strategy that’s rooted in solid business fundamentals.

The Composite Growth Strategy

The framework of my Composite Growth Strategy evaluates companies based on eight critical areas that mimic how you might analyze a private business acquisition:

	1.	Growth Per Share
Focuses on per-share growth in sales, free cash flow, operating cash flow, and gross profit to ensure that growth benefits shareholders directly.

	2.	Absolute Growth
Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance.

	3.	Creditworthiness
Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales.

	4.	Low Dilution
Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares.

	5.	Intangible Monetization
Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow.

	6.	Retained ROIC Composite
Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value.

	7.	Raw ROIC Composite
Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income.

	8.	Shareholder Payout
Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time.

Backtesting Results

To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).

The results demonstrated a clear trend:

	•	The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.

	•	Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.

	•	Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased.

Chart in link below

This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.

Final Thoughts

This strategy was born from the idea of treating stock selection with the same rigor as buying a private business. By focusing on fundamental metrics like growth, ROIC, and shareholder payouts, it aims to identify companies that compound value over time.

&lt;p&gt;Measures overall growth in gross profit, sales, operating cash flow, and free cash flow, emphasizing strong financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3.  Creditworthiness
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluates financial stability by analyzing metrics like cash relative to short-term debt, debt coverage through cash flow, and interest expense as a percentage of sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4.  Low Dilution
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizes companies that avoid diluting shareholders by controlling the growth of outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5.  Intangible Monetization
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assesses how effectively a company utilizes intangible assets, such as intellectual property and goodwill, to generate profits and cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;6.  Retained ROIC Composite
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures how well a company reinvests profits into its business, ensuring efficient use of capital to create long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;7.  Raw ROIC Composite
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzes profitability relative to invested capital, focusing on returns generated from gross profit, operating cash flow, and operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8.  Shareholder Payout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examines how companies reward shareholders through dividends, buybacks, and consistent increases in payout over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backtesting Results&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To validate this strategy, I used backtesting software adjusted for look-ahead bias, spanning data from 2001 to the present. Stocks were ranked every four weeks based on the Composite Growth Strategy, with rankings from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrated a clear trend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;• The top-ranked stocks (quantile 10) achieved an annualized excess return of 4.72% over the benchmark.

• Conversely, the lowest-ranked stocks (quantile 1) underperformed by -7.81% annually.

• Quantiles in between showed a consistent gradient, with performance improving as rankings increased.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chart in link below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates that the metrics used in the Composite Growth Strategy not only identify high-quality businesses but also consistently add value over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy was born from the idea of treating stock selection with the same rigor as buying a private business. By focusing on fundamental metrics like growth, ROIC, and shareholder payouts, it aims to identify companies that compound value over time.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"First let’s get this out the way, Wayfair did see a 30% jump last month, I think this is moreso in anticipation of lowering rates, as of Q3 this yr Wayfair is still reporting a loss currently, I still think they have room to grow.

We don’t need to dive into this piece too deep, but if rates were to lower from highs which they inevitably will home buying goes up and so too does purchases for furniture. Even if there’s customers that think Wayfair is cheap it’s hard to say that they won’t see growth in revenue. So we know revenue will likely grow, which is great but there’s still a negative bottom line.

Wayfair management recently announced some sort of “loyalty program”. You pay an annual fee and you get discounts (which in a scenario where there’s tariffs that raise prices this might help offset some of those costs to the customer). On a surface level you would think this would hurt bottom lines, but there’s a few catches with this. 

For one, management expects those loyal customers who buy an average of two pieces a year will increase to 3 pieces a year, additionally, with 40% of gross profit being spent on advertising, they think they can cut costs by limiting ads where maybe it doesn’t show to a loyal customer who visits Wayfair anyways when looking for furniture. Lastly it’s a small revenue driver but at $29/year the membership cost is so low where it makes that decision to buy a membership that much easier. 

I like the idea since it seems like it’s trying to tackle an efficiency problem in their spending, and tariff wise could offset SOME of the price increases that may make a customer think twice about a purchase. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? Does this stock have more to drop, and do you think this idea could work?

""America is facing the most challenging national security environment in half a century, and we need to move faster to address these challenges. Combatting our adversaries requires change—starting with activating a whole-of-nation approach that accelerates results, pushes boundaries, and disrupts long-standing barriers,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman, CEO, and president of Booz Allen.

“We have seen the positive results of embracing this type of change already,” continued Rozanski. “By working together, Alex and I are creating new mission capabilities that leverage Palantir’s and Booz Allen’s unique technologies and expertise to close mission gaps at the speed of now. Our joint team created a prototype in only 45 days.”

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is by nature not very accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; This list is not to provide accurate date for each events but to provide a better-than-nothing imperfect map to navigate MRNA: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;To enumerate all possible events in one list, enabling us to discern the bigger picture for Moderna amidst the finer details.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer and disclosure are available at the footnote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Main factors that govern $MRNA (To provide context to the items in the timeline below)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Revenue Streams from Commercial Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid Vaccine (&amp;quot;SpikeVax&amp;quot;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSV Vaccine (&amp;quot;mRESVIA&amp;quot;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. FDA Approval/Rejection Updates for Candidates That Have Passed Final Clinical Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid-Flu Combination Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; (A two-in-one vaccine as the name suggests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NextGen Covid Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; (An improved version of the Covid vaccine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSV Vaccine for high risk group&lt;/strong&gt; (Label expansion to &amp;quot;mRESVIA&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Trial Outcomes for Late-Stage Candidates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMV is a virus that can cause birth defects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norovirus causes diarrhea and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individualized Neoantigen Therapy (INT)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(most commonly known as Cancer Vaccine)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targets melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and bladder cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jointly developed with Merck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propionic Acidemia Therapy&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An autosomal recessive, inherited metabolic disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Periodic Cost-Cutting Announcements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These measures are crucial for Moderna to manage cash burns while funding late-stage candidates pending commercialization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Political Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the potential effects of an administration change from Biden to Trump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Competitive Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

,stocks,"Waymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.

The Alphabet-owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.

The expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo’s growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.

Waymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.

“We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver’s performance in adverse weather conditions,” a company spokesperson said.

Waymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.

The company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami’s larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.

Waymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

In November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company’s ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.

And in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo’s robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs. 

Additionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo’s Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said. 

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture’s parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. 

Waymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming. 

GM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco. 

Tesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as “partially automated driving systems,” which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.

SoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon-owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.

After spending good amount of time talking about their 'AI Studio', there isn't  a very direct answer on FCF either, in their Earnings call:

Brent Bracelin

&gt; Helpful color there, Sonalee for you. I know it's early and really look forward to hearing more about the cost rationalization plan, but you do have a bogey here for Q4. Can you walk us through the path to positive free cash flow? I asked because there was an $18 million burn here in Q3 and I'm just trying to think through the rationalization and ability to get to positive free cash flow here in Q4.

Sonalee Parekh, CFO Asana

&gt; Yes, sure. So as you saw, there was some positive movement on sales and marketing and R&amp;D spend in the current quarter. And part of that actually was due to the timing of some of our hiring. But we do expect to get a continued benefit there, again in terms of timing of hires, which is helpful. And then secondly, there are steps we've already started taking around some rationalization of spend, third party spend, which you should see come into Q4. But what I would really urge you to do is Q4. We've reiterated the positive free cash flow, but I think where you'll really start to see the meaningful improvements in operating margin and cash flow is as you look ahead to next year, where we'll provide more detail in March.

Dustin Moskovitz, CEO

&gt; And this is Dustin. I just wanted to add on to that. I mean, we're really looking at, free cash flow is always a little bit lumpy. So we're really looking at the progress on the operational leverage and how things trend from here into next year. So feel good about Q4, but the real goal is to build up a margin through next year, not to just arrive at the free cash flow.

,stocks,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

,stocks,"Hi,

I've been researching both of these companies and would like to hear some opinions from others.

NVO seems like the better company in terms of value, but LLY appears to have a broader portfolio of products, which makes me think their competitive advantage might be stronger.

1. Do you think LLY has a stronger competitive advantage?
2. Do you believe both companies have a strong competitive advantage?

Both companies seem very similar, which makes me wonder why LLY is valued so much higher than NVO. The only reasons I can think of are that LLY is an American company and focuses on a broader range of therapeutic areas. However, these factors don’t seem enough to justify such a significantly higher valuation compared to NVO.

I currently think NVO is the better company and investment.

What are your thoughts? Is LLY's higher valuation justified? Also, do you think investing in either of these companies is a good way to diversify into the medical sector?

,stocks,"Last night, Samsara Holdings (Ticker: IOT) reported earnings that comfortably beat both EPS and revenue expectations. Despite strong performance, the stock fell over 10% after hours. As the market said: “Cool, but your Q4 guidance is $0.8M shy of what we wanted, so here’s a **10% drop in your stock price** for your troubles.” 

  
**What Does Samsara Do?**  
Samsara provides sensors and cloud-based software to help manage vehicle fleets and industrial operations. Their Internet of Things (IoT) platform enables GPS tracking, monitors routes, assesses vehicle performance, and now includes cutting-edge AI-powered safety features.

**Earnings Highlights:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 36% YoY.
* **Large Customer Expansion:** Increased share of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from large customers ($100k+ ARR contracts).

**So Why the Drop?**  
Apparently, Wall Street got hung up on guidance. Samsara revised its Q4 revenue target to a midpoint of $335M, which is… drumroll… **$0.8M less than analysts expected.**

Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a **$3 billion market cap wipeout.** 

**Why I’m Still Buying:**

1. **Big Moves Up-Market:** Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.
2. **Innovation FTW:** Their AI-powered **Drowsiness Detection** (launched in October) uses **38 billion minutes of video training** to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.
3. **Consistently Outperforming:** This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.

  
The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I'm a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the company that just grew revenue by 36% is being punished for rounding down. This modest adjustment led to a &lt;strong&gt;$3 billion market cap wipeout.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I’m Still Buying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Moves Up-Market:&lt;/strong&gt; Samsara is snagging bigger clients and expanding internationally, showing they’ve got staying power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation FTW:&lt;/strong&gt; Their AI-powered &lt;strong&gt;Drowsiness Detection&lt;/strong&gt; (launched in October) uses &lt;strong&gt;38 billion minutes of video training&lt;/strong&gt; to spot tired drivers. Yawning? Head-nodding? Face-rubbing? Samsara knows, and they’ll tell you (and your boss). It’s next-gen safety tech that can save lives and dollars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistently Outperforming:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a company that has a habit of beating its own guidance. Personally, I’d bet they’ll do it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, this stock drop is a classic case of Wall Street overreacting to decimal places. If you’re in it for the long haul, Samsara’s story—international expansion, innovative products, and solid execution—remains intact. I am of the opinion that represents a good buy opportunity of a stock I&amp;#39;m a long term fan of, would love to hear others take on the company and if i missed anything!&lt;/p&gt;

Intapp is stock price has doubled since its IPO and is up more than 60% year-to-date, although the valuation still has a lot of upside

I note that the market for Intapp is services is huge, with a target market (TAM) of $46 billion, and the company currently has a market share of $500 million, which means it has a market share of about 1.1%. The company has demonstrated its strong growth potential by expanding its product portfolio and utilizing a low-code approach, attracting some of the top firms in the financial, legal and accounting industries as clients

Intapp is clients include well-known companies such as Lazard, Carlyle, and EY. The partnership with Microsoft, in particular, has been crucial for the company, as Intapp is software can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Azure marketplace and runs on the Azure platform. Microsoft's sales network also helps raise awareness of Intapp is products

I found that Intapp is annual recurring revenue growth rate was 27% and that the company's net revenue retention rate was 119%, which is much higher than what is common in the industry. The company has been successful in expanding its existing customer spend and further driving revenue growth through new industry expansion

In the most recent quarter, Intapp achieved rapid earnings growth, with its pro-rata operating income increasing by more than 100% and operating margin increasing by 640 basis points year-over-year

Despite Intapp is strong financials, the stock remains relatively well valued. With a current market capitalization of $5.2 billion, it is valued at a multiple of 9.0x EV/FY 2025 revenues and 7.8x EV/FY 2026 revenues based on revenue growth expectations over the next several years

Intapp is a company with strong growth potential, the demand for its products in specific industries has brought it a large number of customers and its partnership with Microsoft has further strengthened its market position.

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the third consecutive reduction and one that came with a cautionary tone about additional reductions in coming years. 

In a move widely anticipated by markets, the Federal Open Market Committee cut its overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, back to the level where it was in December 2022 when rates were on the move higher. 

Though there was little intrigue over the decision itself, the main question had been over what the Fed would signal about its future intentions as inflation holds steadily above target and economic growth is fairly solid, conditions that don’t normally coincide with policy easing. 

In delivering the 25 basis point cut, the Fed indicated that it probably would only lower twice more in 2025, according to the closely watched “dot plot” matrix of individual members’ future rate expectations. The two cuts indicated slice in half the committee’s intentions when the plot was last updated in September. 

Assuming quarter-point increments, officials indicated two more cuts in 2026 and another in 2027. Over the longer term, the committee sees the “neutral” funds rate at 3%, 0.1 percentage point higher than the September update as the level has drifted gradually higher this year. 

For the second consecutive meeting, one FOMC member dissented: Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wanted the Fed to maintain the previous rate. Governor Michelle Bowman voted no in November, the first time a governor voted against a rate decision since 2005. 

The fed funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but also influences a variety of consumer debt such as auto loans, credit cards and mortgages. 

The post-meeting statement changed little except for a tweak regarding the “extent and timing” of further rate changes, a slight language change from the November meeting. 

The cut came even through the committee jacked up its projection for full-year gross domestic product growth to 2.5%, half a percentage point higher than September. However, in the ensuing years the officials expect GDP to slow down to its long-term projection of 1.8%. 

Other changes to the Summary of Economic Projections saw the committee lower its expected unemployment rate this year to 4.2% while headline and core inflation according to the Fed’s preferred gauge also were pushed higher to respective estimates of 2.4% and 2.8%, slightly higher than the September estimate and above the Fed’s 2% goal. 

The committee’s decision comes with inflation not only holding above the central bank’s target but also while the economy is projected by the Atlanta Fed to grow at a 3.2% rate in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate has hovered around 4%. 

Though those conditions would be most consistent with the Fed hiking or holding rates in place, officials are wary of keeping rates too high and risking an unnecessary slowdown in the economy. Despite macro data to the contrary, a Fed report earlier this month noted that economic growth had only risen “slightly” in recent weeks, with signs of inflation waning and hiring slowing. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the rate cuts are an effort to recalibrate policy as it does not need to be as restrictive under the current conditions. 

With Wednesday’s move, the Fed will have cut benchmark rates by a full percentage point since September, a month during which it took the unusual step of lowering by a half point. The Fed generally likes to move up or down in smaller quarter-point increments as its weighs the impact of its actions. 

Despite the aggressive moves lower, markets have taken the opposite tack. 

Mortgage rates and Treasury yields both have risen sharply during the period, possibly indicating that markets do not believe the Fed will be able to cut much more. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury most recently yielded 4.215%, putting it in the upper range of the Fed’s rate move Wednesday.",t2_4daatxkf,False,,0,False,"Fed cuts by a quarter point, indicates fewer reductions ahead",[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1hh8x49,False,dark,0.98,,public,709,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,709,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1734548562.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

1. Intel is currently trading at 10-20% below its own book value. This does not yet say anything about possible growth options, but it does limit the possible downside potential because it makes takeovers increasingly realistic. Remember the many interested parties when Intel was last at $19.

2. Cleaning up a common myth. Before I looked into Intel and I only heard about constantly crashing stock prices and bad news flow, I thought Intel was on the verge of insolvency. But that is not the case. Intel has a debt-to-equity ratio that is quite healthy and continues to generate 50 billion in revenue per year. With a conservative profit margin of 20% (below the historical average), Intel would make 10 billion euros in profit, giving it a PE of 8 at the current share price.

3. Pat Gelsinger's departure is definitely linked to a neglect of the product line. Without Foundry, Intel Products would have made a profit of $3.4 billion in the last quarter alone despite its current poor product range. Even if 18A fails and Intel spins off Foundry, the company is the opposite of dead. By comparison, when AMD spun off Global Foundries in 2009, the share price jumped 20% on the day of the announcement and tripled over the course of the year. Chip manufacturing is a very thankless business. That is why TSMC has a monopoly in the manufacturing of the most modern semiconductors that was only built up with state support.

4. Intel's improving CPU lineup, driven by the Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, positions it well for a recovery in the PC and server markets. The first Panther Lake chips, which are to be produced on Intel's 18A, are already in initial testing at the OEM. These chips are to be released in the second half of 2025 and 70% produced in Intel's own factories, which could heavily increase margins.  I don't want to sugarcoat anything. The last year was very difficult for Intel. First, there were stability issues with Raptor Lake CPUs, which even led to a lawsuit against the company. Then the new Core Ultra Desktop CPUs disappointed, proving efficient but in some cases even lagging behind the performance of the previous chip generation in gaming. But Intel still holds between 60-70% of the global CPU market. AMD's CPUs perform particularly well in gaming, and the switch from Intel to AMD is currently taking place primarily in the niche market of self-built PCs. In the OEM market, Intel continues to dominate massively because AMD cannot provide the quantity of chips needed and the focus here is on factors where Intel still at least matches AMD.

5. The B580. While the pure specifications of the new Intel Battlemage graphics card are nothing special, they have received very positive feedback from a large number of reviewers, precisely because of their very low price, and are currently sold out almost everywhere. The B580 and upcoming graphics cards won't change Intel's bottom line for the time being, but the rapid and extremely good development over just 2 generations shows me that Intel's innovative spirit has not yet died.

6. Let's now turn to 18A and the opportunities that come with it. While the departure of Gelsinger has raised doubts about the success of 18A, all the latest published news indicates that 18A is on the right track. The process currently has a defect density of 0.4 defects per square centimetre, which is only slightly worse than the TSMC benchmarks of 0.33 defects on the older N7 and N5 nodes at comparable development stages – about a year before entering mass production. Since the standard for this development stage is usually below 0.5 defects per square centimetre, this means that Intel could well be within industry standards for advanced nodes and should be sufficient to achieve viable yields. So, if we are to believe the ex-CEO and the current interim CEOs, we have nothing to worry about here.

7. Should Trump also impose tariffs on Taiwan, Intel won't even have to be the best player anymore, because with a snap of the fingers, its foundry business will be 20% cheaper than TSMC. And that is truly not unrealistic. Trump said in the podcast with Joe Rogan that he considers the subsidies from the Chips Act to be nonsensical and would rather go the route of tariffs. However, since the subsidies from the Chips Act have already been paid, Intel would benefit twice over.

8. For me, one of the biggest bull cases for the foundry business: the big tech companies no longer want to finance NVIDIA's 50% margins. Until recently, FOMO drove the market, with every big company wanting to acquire the best GPUs for fear of missing out. However, AI currently seems to be yielding less return than hoped for, which is why the switch to significantly cheaper and now very competitive ASIC in-house developments such as Google's TPUs seems inevitable. The multi-billion dollar deal to produce Amazon's AI chips on 18A was just the beginning.

The semiconductor company reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.79, compared to Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $1.76, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $8.7 billion, which was in line with analysts’ expectations.

Micron’s outlook was weak, though. It guided the current quarter to $7.9 billion in sales, at the midpoint of its range, versus an $8.9 billion estimate from analysts.

“While consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a press release. “We continue to gain share in the highest margin and strategically important parts of the market and are exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.”

Micron shares were down as much as 17% in late trading following the report.

In management’s prepared remarks for the earnings call, the company blamed the outlook on a weaker-than-expected PC upgrade cycle. Management also saw softness in the auto and industrial markets.

Micron is a leader in the markets for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which is used in desktop computers and servers, and for flash memory, which is found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. It has also become a key supplier of HBM (high-bandwidth memory) for artificial intelligence servers.

\-Replacement GPU are available on a budget when NVDA can't meet supply demand in the next few years

\-It's the best CPU for consumers and data centers, no doubt about it. and you need CPU to reason about AI models trained on GPU

\-The PC market will enter a 4-5 year upgrade period next year, especially with the end of Windows 10 support

\-AMD may release next-gen consoles for which it makes custom processors

,stocks,"JNJ is currently trading at $146.4 per share, with a market capitalization of $352.49 billion. But the market may be overlooking its potential.

Several valuation models indicate JNJ is priced below its intrinsic value. Estimates range from a 31.7% to a 48.8% discount. Lemme break this down:  


* **Intrinsic Value Estimate:** $192.8 per share. This is based on a conservative growth outlook.
* **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model:** $217.9 per share. This calculation uses a 6.9% discount rate and a 3.0% long-term growth rate.
* **Relative Valuation:** $167.6 per share. Even using this method, which often shows lower values than intrinsic value models, JNJ shows upside potential. 



The consistency across these different valuation methods supports the conclusion of a price below fair value.  


Now, let's look at the financial picture. JNJ's last twelve months (LTM) free cash flow (FCF) was $19.5 billion, generated on LTM revenue of $87.7 billion. Its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) margin is 21.1%, slightly below its five-year average of 22.4%. However, the market appears to be pricing in a -2.8% annual decline in free cash flow over the next decade. This is in contrast to JNJ's three-year average FCF growth of 4.6% and the industry average of 8.2%. This discrepancy suggests the market's outlook may be too pessimistic.  


Projections for the next ten years (2024-2034) show:  


* Revenue growth from $88.7 billion to $130.3 billion (a 4.0% CAGR).
* Operating income (EBIT) increasing from $22.1 billion to $32.4 billion.
* Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) rising from $20.9 billion to $30.6 billion (a 2.3% CAGR). 

This projected growth is steady and reflects the stability often associated with established companies like JNJ. The market-implied value of growth (MIVoG) is 27.8% of enterprise value, suggesting the market may be underestimating its future growth potential.  


Based on my projections, expected annual returns are approximately 3.1% over three years and 6.8% over five years. These returns include projected earnings growth (3.7%), shareholder yield (4.0%), and a decrease in valuation multiples (-4.6%).

JNJ has a slightly high P/E ratio, yeah, but the price-to-value gap and strong cash flow generation make it an interesting stock to watch for. Overall score: 9 of 10, according to Value Sense.

I'd like to share a short thesis for Carvana ($CVNA). I know there have been a few posts on Carvana outlining fraud or technical analysis on the more degenerate places on reddit but I'd like to present a more complete thesis that the Carvana implosion will happen in the next 8 to 13 months - perhaps less. It's really a question of when confidence in the company gets shot.

It may not be this upcoming earnings period but certainly could be the next. I'll be following CarMax closely as the press release announcing their earnings for this week a full 15 days early - never before has CarMax issued a press release for a standard earnings date before the quarter ended. CarMax's earnings beat/misses don't seem to correlate with Carvana's earnings beat/misses.

How do I know that Carvana is going to collapse? Because I read the bonds. Their free cash flow cannot cover the repayment scheme and their early payments are lipstick on a pig which have no meaningful effect. This was known when the deal was pushed through. I'm fairly certain that as Carvana went up and up and up people forgot some of those top line numbers and those dates.

The Bonds:

Tranche 1: 12.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2028

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K. or Cash (CVNA's discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 2: 13.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% or 11% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2030

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K. or 11% Cash (CVNA's discretion) February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

Tranche 3: 14.0% P.I.K./ 9.0% Cash Senior Secured Notes Due 2031

Interest Payments due February 15 and August 15, commencing February 15 2024

P.I.K. February 15, 2024 and August 15th, 2024

P.I.K.February 15, 2025 and August 15th, 2025

9% Cash February 15, 2026 and August 15th, 2026

A little translation: P.I.K. is Paid In Kind - basically added to the principle at that interest rate. That provides a fair amount of leeway for Carvana to kick the can down the road, however, that road ""ends"" on August 15th. In October/November's earnings they'll be forced to addressed the repayments which exceed their free cash flow. Or not. After that, on February 15th 2026 a whole lotta money is due and there's no way they can not address it in February's earnings call. Actually, there's little value in computing how much is due at those times because it simply cannot be repaid. Free cash flow for the last two quarters was around $600-$700m (total), and debt payments will be close to $220M or more in any 2 quarters - a full third of the (now) positive FCF. Carvana will not be able to buy cars to expand. And the chance of them doubling their free cash flow is slim - even as they eak out a slim profit.

I could only see Tranche 1 August payments they made last earnings as a token ""show of force"" - $100m prepayment is a drop in the bucket on $5-7B in debt and only trims the expected interest by virtually nothing. It also does explain why the executive team is bailing now - the farther out from these maturities they bail the less likely they could experience clawbacks for engaging in fraud (a'la Sears Roebuck &amp; Co - it's not fraud if it's being conducted openly and for a long time).

Since Caravana is split between Hold through Strong Buy, well, another reason not to trust analysts.

One missed earnings and this company is toast. Increased inflation and this company is toast. Tariffs may support Carvana more than I would like as used cars won't face tariffs, but inflation caused by labor deportations and increased COL from tariffs between Mexico and Canada will completely negate that - particularly if used car loan defaults go up (they are) and loan restrictions start going up (they are according to FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STDSAUTO)

The question is, is this the top? Long term LEAP puts are expensive-ish, but this company will be driven down to $3 within a few months of February - either before or after.

Update/Edit: I ran some interest only numbers which are in the discussion.  Long and the short, CVNA will have interest expenses of about $440M per-year when these convert to cash interest next year, up from interest expenses of $12.5M now.  They also have a $98M unsecured bond due in 2025, which they could possibly refinance or re-issue.  There free cash flow is increasing, from 2024Q1:$100M to 2024Q3: $400M.  However, this needs to be maintained - any economic shocks would still cripple their ability to repay their debt or buy cars.  An strict repayment only holds the debt steady at $5.2B - functionally turning Carvana into a Zombie Corp.  The can could be kicked down the road to 2028, but probably not if interest rates increase.  Interest rate increases or weakness in consumer subprime auto lending lasting longer than a quarter would cripple the company.

,stocks,"Alphabet-owned Waymo announced Monday that it will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Tokyo in early 2025, the company’s first step toward international expansion. 

Waymo hasn’t committed to start commercial service in Tokyo yet, but the robotaxi developer will partner with Japan’s largest taxi operator, Nihon Kotsu, and taxi app GO to start testing its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles in Tokyo’s streets.

To start, Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually operate the Waymo vehicles to map key areas of the Japanese capital, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa, and Kōtō. 

Data from the manned test drives will help train the company’s AI systems. Waymo will also test its robotaxis on a closed course in the U.S. built to mimic driving conditions in Japan.

This is the first phase of the partnerships, which will last several quarters, Waymo told CNBC, adding that it expects to remain in Japan for an extended period.

“Our upcoming road trip to Tokyo gives us the chance to work alongside local partners, government officials, and community groups to understand the new landscape,” Waymo said in a statement. “We’ll learn how Waymo can serve Tokyo’s residents and become a beneficial part of the city’s transportation ecosystem.”

Nihon Kotsu will oversee the management and servicing of Waymo’s vehicles in Japan, the companies said.

Waymo announced a series of expansions across the U.S. in 2024. Earlier this month, the company announced new testing in Miami in 2025, it made its driverless ride hail service available across Los Angeles in November, and in September, it announced planned expansions into Austin and Atlanta in partnership with Uber. 

The move into Japan marks the company’s first in a left-hand traffic market.

Both the Japanese national government and Tokyo Metropolitan government see driverless technology as a potential boon to the country’s aging population, according to research by the World Economic Forum.

Tokyo has designated certain areas as “test zones” for self-driving cars hoping to hasten the arrival of safe driverless transportation systems there.

Several developers are working on autonomous vehicles in Japan, including local startup Tier IV and ZMP, a robotics company that is testing delivery vehicles and buses in Tokyo. Monet Technologies, which is partly owned by Toyota, announced plans to test a self-driving taxi service in Tokyo’s Odaiba district earlier this year.

Waymo’s Japan expansion announcement comes a week after General Motors announced it was abandoning its Cruise robotaxi division. Honda, an outside investor in Cruise, told CNBC that it aimed to launch a driverless ride-hail service in Japan in early 2026 but would re-assess those plans and make adjustments if needed.

Prior to GM’s retreat from robotaxis, Cruise had been one of Waymo’s primary domestic competitors.

,stocks,"This final full trading week of the year will be far from a sleepy slide into the holiday season.

The Federal Reserve is at a pivotal juncture when it comes to the path of interest rates, while the stock market also faces a critical week amid a period of prolonged broadening weakness.

The central bank is widely expected to cut rates Wednesday—a 97% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. That’s probably a little high, particularly given last week’s sticky inflation data.

In fact, several Fed officials are considering arguing against a cut when officials meet later this week, The Wall Street Journal reported. A hold decision would certainly be a surprise.

A cut is still most likely, but the economic data do not suggest an urgent need to reduce borrowing costs at this point. Consumer prices ticked higher to 2.7% in November, well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The economy is still growing at a decent rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, according to the GDPNow estimate, and the jobs market is showing resilience.

The counterargument is that the fed-funds rate of 4.5% to 4.75% has room to come down a bit further to align with economic conditions.

Even if a quarter-point cut does come gift-wrapped as expected for the market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could still be the Grinch who stole Christmas when he speaks after the decision.

A December cut would be the third in succession. That pace cannot continue, so Powell will need to communicate a coming shift in 2025. It could be the last cut for a while, especially given the inflationary impact of Trump’s potential tariffs.

How Powell conveys the message may be critical for the stock market’s reaction.

The S&amp;P 500 is on an unusual run—more stocks have fallen than risen for 10 consecutive days, the longest such streak since Oct. 2000. The index still hit a record high last week but the majority of stocks are struggling.

,stocks,"**Summary:**

Xinyi Solar Holdings (OTCMKTS: XNYIF), one of the world’s largest solar glass manufacturers, is showing solid growth and profitability, yet trades at a **P/E ratio of 6.5** with a **7.2% dividend yield**. Given its fundamentals, the stock seems undervalued relative to peers, potentially due to macro risks (China FUD, OTC listing). Here’s a balanced breakdown.

**The Business**

Xinyi Solar is a **global leader in solar glass production** – a critical component for all photovoltaic (PV) solar panels.

* **Core Segment**: Solar glass manufacturing, serving panel producers worldwide.
* **Revenue Streams**: Primarily regional (China and Asia), with limited exposure to U.S. tariffs.
* **Scale**: Industry-leading capacity and strong cost controls give them an edge in a competitive market.

  
**Key Financials 📊**

1. **Profit Growth**:
   * H1 2024 profits grew **+41% YoY**, showing resilience despite overcapacity fears.
2. **Dividend Yield**:
   * 7.2% yield, well-covered by cash flow, offering income stability.
3. **Valuation**:
   * P/E Ratio: **6.5**, significantly below global solar peers trading at 15–20x earnings.
4. **Margins**:
   * Operating margins are stable, showing efficient production even with pricing pressure.

**Source**: Xinyi Interim Report → [https://www.xinyisolar.com/en/NewsCenter/info.aspx?itemid=828](https://www.xinyisolar.com/en/NewsCenter/info.aspx?itemid=828)

  
**Why It’s Mispriced 🧐**

1. **OTC Stigma**: XNYIF trades OTC in the U.S., limiting visibility and volume.
2. **China Sentiment**: Concerns about Chinese stocks and trade tensions may have spooked investors.
3. **Solar Overcapacity Fears**: The market worries about overproduction, but Xinyi has maintained profitability and margins.

  
**Risks to Consider ⚠️**

* **Geopolitics**: Further U.S. tariffs or trade issues could weigh on sentiment, though Xinyi’s business is regionally focused.
* **Liquidity**: As an OTC stock, trading volume is low, increasing volatility.
* **Market Sentiment**: Negative views on China-related equities can suppress valuation, even if fundamentals are strong.

**The Opportunity**

With solid fundamentals, steady dividends, and an absurdly low valuation, Xinyi Solar could be a mispriced opportunity for value investors. While the risks are real, the financials tell a different story: growth, cash flow, and income stability.

**Questions for the Community:**

1. Do you see undervaluation here, or are the macro risks too significant?
2. How much weight should we place on China-specific fears for regionally focused companies?
3. Are there other solar sector plays that provide similar value with lower risk?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

,stocks,"As a Micron follower, I've always seen the company as having great potential for growth in the memory and storage solutions space. In particular, its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology has me excited about its future performance. Here's my analysis and personal view of Micron:

Micron is scheduled to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on December 18, 2024, and I believe it is likely to exceed market expectations. Analysts are widely forecasting it to report earnings of $1.77 per share, a quantum leap from the $0.95 per share loss reported in the same period last year.

Gross margins were also one of the highlights, growing to 35 percent from a three-year average of 15.8 percent, and are expected to improve further to 39.5 percent in the next quarter.

Micron's market opportunity in high-bandwidth memory gives me confidence. From FY2023 to FY2025, this market size is expected to grow 6.25x to $25 billion. With significant growth in HBM3E chip shipments, Micron is expected to realize a significant climb in both revenue and margins in fiscal 2025.

Micron's HBM3E chips have a significant advantage in performance and energy efficiency, with an expected 20% improvement in energy efficiency. This is particularly important for data center and AI applications.

In particular, the strong demand for memory in the AI market provides great scope for Micron's products. NVIDIA's latest earnings report has proven that there is no slowdown in corporate investment in AI-related devices (such as GPUs), which cannot be supported by Micron's high-performance memory.

Currently, 69% of Micron's revenue comes from DRAM products, and I expect that percentage could increase to 70-75% in fiscal 2025. With the double increase in HBM chip shipments and selling prices, Micron's revenue structure will be more optimized, and profitability will be further improved.

Micron has demonstrated strong shareholder returns over the past few years, having repurchased $4.4 billion of stock since FY2021. If the HBM market continues to grow strongly, I believe Micron may further increase buybacks in the future. The current 12.8% earnings yield also shows its attractiveness as an investment in the semiconductor space.

My Investment View Overall, I am confident in Micron's future. It has demonstrated strong growth potential with its HBM technology leadership and deep integration with the AI market. What's more, the current valuation provides a large margin of safety for investment. I believe Micron's revenue and margins are poised for a significant boost as HBM3E shipments grow significantly in FY2025. Micron's share price is likely to double over the next 12-18 months.

In my view, Micron is not only a value play in the AI/semiconductor space, but also has strong growth momentum. Its market position, technological edge and financial performance all make it a worthy long-term holding. Especially in the first half of 2025, if Micron continues to outperform the HBM market, I believe its share price performance will be even more stunning.

,stocks,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump’s victory and Elon Musk’s instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon’s influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout—a potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla’s data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.  


Full disclosure: I'm currently short the stock. That could change if the price goes down.

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla’s fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a “shadow trainer” for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases—rare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla’s massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla’s vision-only approach—using cameras without lidar—makes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data is not always better, and it’s possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.  The result is a more diverse dataset that’s constantly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.  Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.  Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.  But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.  This means that its data is much richer in quality.  The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla’s suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn’t just an incremental step—it’s an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments—places like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla’s FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” If Waymo’s AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it’s far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla’s suburban data might create a “same-shit-different-day” scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla’s liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.  Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics—which is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it&amp;#39;s a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The scalability myth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo’s reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn’t hold weight for two reasons.  First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla’s camera-only system.  Ironically, Elon’s first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn’t mean it has to be that way.  Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.  When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?  Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It’s AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo’s superior compute power (via Google’s custom TPUs) means it’s clearly dominant in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla bulls often cite Elon’s dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla’s superior approach. But they overlook Google’s hegemony in AI.  They were in the game before anyone.  They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla’s Dojo may be promising, but it’s still a newbie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.  If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo’s technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it&amp;#39;s vastly overvalued.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I&amp;#39;m currently short the stock. That could change if the price goes down.  &lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Broadcom Surge Highlights the Importance of AI

Let’s start with some expert opinions I read over the weekend about Broadcom’s impressive rally views I completely agree with

At the hardware level, training costs are skyrocketing, limiting participation to a few CSP (cloud service providers) that can afford it.     As economies of scale see diminishing returns, these companies are shifting their strategies toward customer acquisition, commercialization, and retention—similar to Microsoft’s current approach.     With growing focus on model deployment and revenue generation, inference is bound to take center stage.     Open source models are becoming more valuable, enabling AI application developers to focus on building apps rather than training models from scratch.     It’s akin to the role Linux played during the cloud operating system boom.

The traditional scaling laws based on data are nearing a bottleneck.     We’re likely approaching the end of the pretraining era, with the future pointing towards the ""Agent and Reason"" age.

Here’s the key takeaway: Broadcom predicts that by 2027, its three largest existing clients (likely ByteDance, Google, and Meta) will deploy over one million arithmetic card units.     Additionally, two more clients are undergoing validation, potentially driving $60–90 billion in AI-related revenue.    That said, expectations for overall AI capital expenditure changes remain modest.

This shift represents more of a structural change in existing capital allocation.   NVIDIA, which currently dominates with over 75% of the arithmetic card market, may see its lead challenged.     Broadcom’s ASIC solutions and NVIDIA’s GPUs could eventually share the market.    Once AI models stabilize, ASIC—being application-specific—could offer a significant cost advantage over general purpose GPU.

For major cloud providers, the massive capital expenditures have sparked criticism from shareholders.     At this point, these companies must demonstrate revenue growth to justify the spending.

As I write this, AVGO  is soaring again.     Broadcom rise was anticipated, but the market sentiment is electrifying.     Investors are desperately hunting for the next NVDA.     After cashing out Tesla last week, I thought Monday might bring a big move for Tesla.     Instead, Broadcom stole the spotlight.     While Tesla did rise, it couldn’t match Broadcom momentum.

,stocks,"**MDB results were impressive**

MDB’s $529.38M (vs estimated $498M) in Q3 is up 22% Y-o-Y. Atlas, their flagship cloud service that works with all hyper-scalers, grew by 26%, accounting for 68% of revenue. EPS was $1.16 (vs estimated 0.67)

**Why MDB fell**

1. Investors were rattled by the CFO/COO's exit, with the company offering little explanation for the departure. However, given that Michael had been with the company since 2015, it seems his exit was well-planned. He sold only 5,000 shares while still holding a significant amount.
2. MongoDB (MDB) has seen an upward trend over the last few months, increasing from $231 in September to $355 by December, prompting some investors to take profits.
3. There was an expectation for a more ambitious forecast for the Atlas platform, which focuses on generating recurring revenue. Nevertheless, the future looks promising for MDB.

**MDB is forecasting stronger Q1 and beyond**

1. The company provided a stronger forecast than expected, projecting $517 million against the anticipated $509 million.
2. Overall, revenue is on an upward trajectory, margins are either stable or improving, cash flow is positive, the balance sheet is getting stronger, and future guidance has been enhanced.
3. The Price to Sales (P/S) ratio has been normalizing: from 20 in Q2'23, down to 16 in Q3'23, and now at 10/11.

&lt;p&gt;MDB’s $529.38M (vs estimated $498M) in Q3 is up 22% Y-o-Y. Atlas, their flagship cloud service that works with all hyper-scalers, grew by 26%, accounting for 68% of revenue. EPS was $1.16 (vs estimated 0.67)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why MDB fell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors were rattled by the CFO/COO&amp;#39;s exit, with the company offering little explanation for the departure. However, given that Michael had been with the company since 2015, it seems his exit was well-planned. He sold only 5,000 shares while still holding a significant amount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB (MDB) has seen an upward trend over the last few months, increasing from $231 in September to $355 by December, prompting some investors to take profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was an expectation for a more ambitious forecast for the Atlas platform, which focuses on generating recurring revenue. Nevertheless, the future looks promising for MDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MDB is forecasting stronger Q1 and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company provided a stronger forecast than expected, projecting $517 million against the anticipated $509 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, revenue is on an upward trajectory, margins are either stable or improving, cash flow is positive, the balance sheet is getting stronger, and future guidance has been enhanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Price to Sales (P/S) ratio has been normalizing: from 20 in Q2&amp;#39;23, down to 16 in Q3&amp;#39;23, and now at 10/11. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Price to Book (P/B) ratio has also decreased from 34 in Q2&amp;#39;23 to 25 in Q3&amp;#39;23, and currently stands at 14.&lt;/li&gt;

Cagrisema:
If they show 25 % weight loss with an okay side effect profile they will have the top of the class drug, which probably will shift momentum in the stock positively. They also just confirmed the full buy of Catalant yesterday. These two things in combination makes a santa rally of 10-20 % possible. Tomorrow we will see an increase of 5-10 % in stock is my guess because of Catalant. And my guess is that the Cagrisema data will be presented during the upcoming week.


They will have many more triggers in the coming time:

Novo Nordisk is expected to present its financial targets for 2025 at the beginning of February, which is important to monitor. 
This should be seen in light of the fact that CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen recently stated during an investor call that, from a mathematical perspective, growth could be expected to land in the “high teens” for the coming year, corresponding to around 17–19%. But the market probably expects a bit more, but if they see much higher growth than that it could significantly move the stock, depending on where revenue growth is anticipated to. Plus the strong dollar would positively influence Novos revenue.

During 2025, Novo Nordisk is expected to present new data – and possibly information about regulatory approval – regarding the oral version of semaglutide, which is essentially Wegovy in pill form.
The oral version of semaglutide demonstrated a 17% weight loss in a 68-week study, matching the results of the Wegovy injection.

In addition to weight-loss medications in pill form, attention may also turn to semaglutide’s effects on Alzheimer’s disease and much more.

Novo has always guided quite conservatively and they are the ones themselves who has communicated that they expect around 25 % weight loss on Cagrisema, so it would surprise me if the data is worse than that. If 23 % expect 10-15 % drawdown in the stock shortterm.

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

The latest report showed a 5% increase in revenues, but the profits were a bit weaker than expected. A big part of the dip seems to stem from concerns about slower growth – competition is rising, and stricter regulations could impact things in the short term.

For those who aren't familiar, Evolution AB is a leading company in the online gambling space, specializing in live casino solutions. They operate platforms like Evolution Gaming and NetEnt, offering live dealer games to online casinos. They’ve been incredibly successful in dominating the live casino market, with a strong presence in Europe and significant expansion in North America and Asia.

Looking ahead, I still think the company has a solid long-term outlook. Despite short-term challenges, Evolution continues to innovate, and its market leadership in live casino gaming remains strong. They’re also tapping into emerging markets, which could fuel growth moving forward.

So, should you buy now? If you're a long-term investor and can handle some short-term volatility, this could be a good opportunity to buy the dip. But if you’re looking for quick returns, it might be better to wait and see if the stock drops even further.

,stocks,"As a longtime Broadcom investor, I am very pleased with its fourth quarter and full year FY2024 results.

QUARTERLY REVENUE: Broadcom achieved record revenues of $14.05 billion, up 51% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.

Artificial Intelligence Revenue: full year revenue reached $12.2 billion, up 220% year-over-year, far outperforming market expectations.

Free cash flow: reached $5.5 billion, or 39% of revenue, demonstrating strong profitability.

Gross margin: maintained at a high level of 77%, further demonstrating its efficient operating model and strong market position.

VMware Acquisitions and Growth Potential

The integration of VMware has been significant and has had an immediate and profound impact on Broadcom is profitability:

Software revenues: nearly doubled from $2.8 billion to $5.8 billion since the acquisition.

High Gross Margins: Gross margins in the software business are as high as 90%, which provides the company with ample cash flow and sets the stage for future expansion and return to shareholders.

From my perspective, VMware is integration not only improves operational efficiency, but also provides solid support for further growth in FY2025.

Leadership in AI infrastructure

Broadcom is performance in AI gives me confidence in its future:

Core products: Broadcom is custom AI gas pedals, Ethernet switches and optical transceivers continue to lead the market, meeting strong demand in the data center and cloud computing markets.

Revenue drivers: High growth in AI-related businesses further solidifies Broadcom is leadership in AI infrastructure.

Broadcom is outlook for Q1 2025 makes me even more optimistic about its future:

Revenue forecast: expected to reach $14.6 billion, up 22% YoY and 4% sequentially.

EBITDA forecast: expected to be $9.64 billion, with continued industry-leading margins.

Shareholder returns: Dividend increased 11% to $0.59 per share and payout ratio lowered to 0.50, demonstrating free cash flow growth potential.

Customer Diversification: Despite Apple's plans to reduce its reliance on Broadcom's Wi-Fi + Bluetooth chips, I'm confident that Broadcom is new AI gas pedal partnership agreement with Apple will more than offset the potential impact.

Risk diversification: Broadcom is business spans multiple sectors, including AI, software, wireless and networking, greatly reducing the risk of dependence on a single customer.

As a long-time tech stock investor, I think Broadcom is impressive performance in AI, data centers, and software, combined with efficient management and strategic acquisitions, make its long-term growth prospects very solid.

Its excellent margins and strong cash flow performance reduce investment risk, and I think Broadcom offers a good risk-reward ratio.

From my perspective, Broadcom is a quality stock to buy and hold for the long term.

Broadcom has demonstrated strong profitability and potential for continued growth with its leadership position in artificial intelligence and software, as well as synergies from the VMware integration. Although there is some uncertainty in the external market environment, Broadcom is diversified business structure and efficient operational management give me confidence in its future.

Particularly after the launch of AIP, which integrates generative AI and data analysis, the scope of market applications has significantly expanded. Long-term contracts in the defense sector appear to provide a stable source of cash flow. The financial reports indicate a turnaround to profitability, marking an important milestone for a data analytics company. Emerging markets such as supply chain and healthcare also present potential growth opportunities

A positive signal lies in its continued momentum. Recently, the company has collaborated with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Shield AI, further strengthening its position in defense technology. These developments enhance its profitability and market competitiveness

For those following the news, the market dips on Monday and Tuesday were mainly due to institutions and funds avoiding risks ahead of the CPI data release. Yesterday, the CPI met expectations, suggesting a strong likelihood of U.S interest rate cuts—a positive signal for the market. Being added to the Nasdaq-100 would undoubtedly provide the best incentive for further growth

Long-term government contracts and defense projects offer stability, which is crucial for withstanding the volatility of the tech sector. Palantir’s shift to profitability marks a significant milestone, demonstrating its maturing business model and growing earnings potential

With strong technical capabilities in AI and big data analytics, I am highly confident in Palantir’s future. In the medium and long term, Palantir is likely to benefit from its technological innovation and the expansion of the AI market. As an investor, I find Palantir’s performance this year to be surprising and impressive

Its long-term partnerships with the government and the attainment of FedRAMP High authorization further prove the security and compliance of its cloud services. Palantir has significantly exceeded market expectations, with rapid growth in demand for its AI-related products driving profitability

If you analyze this stock closely, you’ll notice that for the past two months, it has shown consistent growth every Friday

With long-term growth prospects, I believe Palantir will deliver solid returns for investors

,stocks,"Costco on Thursday beat Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and sales estimates, as it got a boost in part from higher membership fees.

Here’s how the warehouse club did for the fiscal first quarter compared to what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: $4.04 vs. $3.79 expected
* Revenue: $62.15 billion vs. $62.08 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Nov. 24, Costco’s net income rose to $1.80 billion, or 4.04 per share, from $1.59 billion, or $3.58 per share in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $57.80 billion in the year-ago period.

Costco has benefitted from its reputation for selling bulk items at better value, as U.S. households feel the cumulative effect of higher food and housing prices. The membership-based club also hiked its annual membership fee for the first time in about seven years. The quarterly results are the first Costco has reported since that fee increase took effect in September.

Costco’s membership fees came in at $1.17 billion, compared to the $1.16 billion Wall Street had expected.

As of Thursday’s close, share of Costco are up nearly 50% so far this year, surpassing the 27% gains of the S&amp;P 500 during the same time period. Shares closed at $988.39 on Thursday.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

,stocks,"Adobe shares fell 14% on Thursday, their steepest drop since September 2022, after the software vendor issued disappointing revenue guidance.

Sales in the fiscal first quarter will be between $5.63 billion and $5.68 billion, Adobe said in its fourth-quarter earnings report late Wednesday. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.73 billion, according to LSEG.

Analysts at TD Cowen downgraded the stock to hold from buy, while Wells Fargo kept its buy rating following what it called a “frustrating ’24” for the company. The stock is now down 20% for the year, badly trailing the Nasdaq, which is up 33% and crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday.

While Adobe’s forecast trailed estimates, the company’s fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $4.81, topping the average analyst estimate of $4.66, according to LSEG. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $5.61 billion, beating the average estimate of $5.54 billion.

Monetizing generative artificial intelligence, especially in stand-alone offerings such as Firefly image generation or additional offerings across the Creative Cloud, has been central to Adobe’s growth strategy.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank maintained their buy rating but lowered their target price from $650 to $600.

“These results and guidance require a bit of faith in the full year next year,” the analysts wrote. Still, they said, “We see tangible evidence that Adobe is one of few application software companies in our coverage successfully monetizing generative AI today.”

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

,stocks,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a core driver of the modern economy, and I am increasingly seeing its far-reaching impact across a wide range of industries. As someone who cares about investment opportunities, I see great potential in investing in AI-related companies, especially those that are leaders in technology, business model and market share. Of the many choices, there are two companies in particular that I favor and believe can help investors grow their wealth: Nvidia and Palantir Technologies

Nvidia is the leader in AI hardware and has been a mainstay in high-performance computing and deep learning. I've been impressed with the technical strength of its GPUs, which are used in a wide range of applications such as data centers, cloud computing, autonomous driving, and generative AI. As the demand for computing power for generative AI applications like ChatGPT explodes, I'm confident that demand for Nvidia's products will soar even further

In 2023, Nvidia's data center business saw record revenues and demonstrated technology leadership with its new H100 GPUs and Grace Hopper superchips. Combined with partnerships with cloud giants like AWS and Azure, I think Nvidia's market share will continue to grow. Analysts predict the generative AI market will reach nearly $100 billion over the next five years, and Nvidia will undoubtedly be a big part of that wave. I believe that holding the company's stock for the long term is expected to provide significant returns

Palantir's focus on data analytics and AI solutions gives me confidence in its market potential. The company offers the Gotham and Foundry platforms for government and enterprise, respectively, to help users extract value from large-scale data. I am particularly interested in Palantir's newly launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which combines generative AI technology to provide users with real-time data insights and decision support

On the financial front, Palantir has become profitable in 2023, which is an important turning point for a company. The company has also successfully expanded into emerging markets such as healthcare and energy, and has signed a long-term contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, further strengthening its revenue stream. I see more growth opportunities for Palantir in the future as the demand for data-driven decision-making in the enterprise grows

While both companies look promising, I also recognize that the AI industry is rapidly changing and that innovations from competitors can pose challenges. In addition, government regulation of AI could increase uncertainty, and the high valuations of these companies could lead to high volatility in their stock prices

For me, Nvidia and Palantir represent different opportunities for hardware and software in AI, with Nvidia dominating the infrastructure space with its hardware strengths and Palantir meeting the needs of enterprises and governments with its data analytics capabilities.

I am aware that folks at JP, Goldman, etc. with quant degrees know a lot more than I do. I'm just a lowly accountant. But we ain't talking active trading strategy here. This is about doing a little better than passive index, buy-n-hold. Well, that's why we login to Reddit, afterall.

**Context-2:** We've had 26% and 28% gains in S&amp;P in last two years. So, 2025 is likely to be a 'modest' year or a bad year.

Portfolio A: 100% in S&amp;P, e.g. $10,000

Portfolio B: 90% in cash (money market fund), 10% used to buy Dec-2025 call option, 10% OTM.

Portfolio C: 90% in cash (money market fund), 5% used to buy Jun-2025 call option, 5% OTM, repeated again mid-year, with Dec 2025 option.

^(Note: I've checked option prices, so the projected profits are reasonable correct. Cash return assumed at 4% ($360 on $9000).)

||Bullish scenario S&amp;P +10%|Boring year scenario, V shaped recovery|Bearish scenario, S&amp;P -10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A: 100% of $10,000 in S&amp;P|$1000 gain|$0 (took on market risk, suffered volatility). |\- $1000 |
|B: Cash + Option|$360 gain on cash + $2000 gain on the option. That Dec-2025 option expected to become 3X in bull market. This is a resonable assumption. Just see the option chain. |$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.|
|C: Cash + multiple bullish option trades|$360 gain on cash + $3000 gain on the options. 4X jump on two options bought with $500. Note that these are only 5% OTM options, so this guy got lucky twice. Because, the distance to strike is less, gains are bigger. |$360 gain on cash + $1500 gain on only one option. 4X jump on one of the two options bought with $500.|Minus $640 - as above. |



**Conclusion**: Leaving 90% in cash/ money markets, and just buying affordable OTM Calls with far-out expiry, is more profitable and less volatile than the Booglehead way. This isn't a surprise, because effectively, you leverage (i.e. borrow) to play the market risk, without taking on full downside risk. This costs you, in terms of premium, and doesn't pay off in a boring, flat market (middle column in table above).

**Remark 1:** This 'strategy' is inspired from Nancy Pelosi. She is fond of buying December 2027 Calls in millions. Perhaps, her calls suffer temporary dips in short term, but when the thing plays out, she has 10X-ed her capital.

**Remark 2:** Aware that emergency funds should be separate from invested portfolio, but this $9000 cash could give the user a bit more peace of mind, because it stays as cash for full year, ready at fingertips, irrespective of the market conditions.

&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Boring year scenario, V shaped recovery&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;A: 100% of $10,000 in S&amp;amp;P&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$0 (took on market risk, suffered volatility).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;- $1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;B: Cash + Option&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $2000 gain on the option. That Dec-2025 option expected to become 3X in bull market. This is a resonable assumption. Just see the option chain.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash. Option money evaporated. Net loss minus $640.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;C: Cash + multiple bullish option trades&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $3000 gain on the options. 4X jump on two options bought with $500. Note that these are only 5% OTM options, so this guy got lucky twice. Because, the distance to strike is less, gains are bigger.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$360 gain on cash + $1500 gain on only one option. 4X jump on one of the two options bought with $500.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Minus $640 - as above.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Leaving 90% in cash/ money markets, and just buying affordable OTM Calls with far-out expiry, is more profitable and less volatile than the Booglehead way. This isn&amp;#39;t a surprise, because effectively, you leverage (i.e. borrow) to play the market risk, without taking on full downside risk. This costs you, in terms of premium, and doesn&amp;#39;t pay off in a boring, flat market (middle column in table above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 1:&lt;/strong&gt; This &amp;#39;strategy&amp;#39; is inspired from Nancy Pelosi. She is fond of buying December 2027 Calls in millions. Perhaps, her calls suffer temporary dips in short term, but when the thing plays out, she has 10X-ed her capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Aware that emergency funds should be separate from invested portfolio, but this $9000 cash could give the user a bit more peace of mind, because it stays as cash for full year, ready at fingertips, irrespective of the market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

Tesla’s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since Donald Trump’s election victory early last month. The stock’s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.

Musk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.

The world’s richest person, who’s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.

His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies’ budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level.

“The stock is responding to the Trump bump,” Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that “Musk’s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla’s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.”

On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that “the market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.”

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.

Since Trump’s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.

Tesla’s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company’s shares plunged 29% in the first three months of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla’s core business, which reported declining revenue in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.

In its third-quarter earnings report in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” That forecast was ahead of analysts’ predictions.

,stocks,"Apple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.

The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.

Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.

The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.

Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.

The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.

Many investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.

The integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.

Users need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.

After updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple’s AI models, that the service needs to operate.

The Wednesday updates also include Apple’s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.

&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple’s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won’t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple users don’t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup’s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"I’ve been closely monitoring UnitedHealth Group (UNH) recently, and I noticed it’s been under significant pressure, with the stock now hovering around $518, down nearly 3% today. Last week’s news regarding the tragic incident with the CEO definitely shook things up, but I’m wondering: is this selloff more of an emotional reaction than a reflection of the company’s fundamentals?

Here’s my breakdown of the situation and why I think this could be an opportunity for long-term investors:

- Trailing P/E is on the high side at 34.69, but the forward P/E is 17.89, much more reasonable and closer to sector averages.

- The PEG ratio is 1.47, which suggests a fair valuation given its growth prospects.

- Revenue grew +9.2% YoY in the most recent quarter, with net income up +3.66%.

- Dividend growth has been consistently strong, averaging over 20% annual increases since 2010. Current dividend yield sits at 1.6%, with room for future hikes given a payout ratio of ~52%.

- The stock tested support around $515 today and saw a slight bounce.

- VWAP is $526, so the stock is trading below its average price, indicating near-term bearish sentiment, but it could also mean a potential opportunity for buyers.

UNH remains the leader in the healthcare sector, a defensive industry with favorable long-term trends like an aging population and rising demand for healthcare services.
Analysts have a target price range of $580-$600, suggesting a potential upside of 10-15% from current levels.

Do you think this drop is more of an overreaction tied to recent news rather than a reflection of any real weakness in UNH’s business fundamentals? Could the stock test lower levels (e.g., $500), or is the $515 support a solid floor for a potential recovery?

So, what happens when a publicly traded company decides to go private at a buyout share price that is below my average buying price of the stock ( being a minority share holder)

1. Say for example, I bought 100 shares of one company @ 100 USD each, however now, it decides to go private through a share buyout @ 90 USD / share. Will I be forced out of my position at a realised loss? Also, what if the price / share climbs up to 120 / share at the time of privatisation? Would I get realised @ buyout price of 90 / share or trading price of 120/ share?

2. Now, just by the news release, the company currently trades @ 110 USD / share. Will it be better to sell all my holding @ a realised profit based on the euphoria of the proposal, or do I hold on to it and wait and watch whether the privatisation deal goes through or not, since I still believe that the company has a moat in the industry it is in and I trust it’s longer term success. 

3. Considering point 2 above, would it make any sense to sell the shares now to lock in the profit and just in case the privatisation deal doesn’t happen for any reason, euphoria “might” fade and company price “could” trade @ a price below my existing average, then I could just buy back into the company story at a lower average price as it is currently trading @ higher multiples to earnings.
